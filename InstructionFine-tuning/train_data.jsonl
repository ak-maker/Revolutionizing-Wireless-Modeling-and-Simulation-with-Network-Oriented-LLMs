It inherently parallelizes simulations via batching, where each element in the batch dimension is simulated independently. The first tensor dimension is always used for inter-frame parallelization, similar to an outer for-loop in Matlab/NumPy simulations.\n\nTo keep the dataflow efficient, Sionna follows a few simple design principles:\n\n1. Signal-processing components are implemented as individual Keras layers.\n2. `tf.float32` is used as the preferred datatype and `tf.complex64` for complex-valued datatypes. This allows simpler re-use of components.\n3. Models can be developed in eager mode allowing simple (and fast) modification of system parameters.\n4. Number crunching simulations can be executed in the faster graph mode or even XLA acceleration is available for most components.\n5. Whenever possible, components are automatically differentiable via auto-grad to simplify the deep learning design-flow.\n6. Code is structured into sub-packages for different tasks such as channel coding, mapping, etc.\n\nThe division into individual blocks simplifies deployment and all layers and functions come with unit tests to ensure their correct behavior. These paradigms simplify the re-useability and reliability of the components for a wide range of communications related applications.\n\nThe package also supports multi-dimensional tensors, with most layers operating at the last dimension and can have arbitrary input shapes. It also has built-in plotting functions for easy visualization of results.\n\nIn terms of design, Sionna aims at hiding system complexity into Keras layers while providing as much flexibility as possible. Thus, most layers have several choices of init parameters. The package also supports both eager and graph execution modes, with the latter providing much higher throughputs when a fast GPU is available. For exhaustive training and Monte-Carlo simulations, the graph mode with XLA and GPU acceleration is the preferred choice."}]}

As per the 4G/5G system, `ResourceGrid` would represent a time slot. An important feature of `ResourceGrid` is that it can also indicate guard and DC carriers which are nulled, allowing more flexibility on the OFDM sequence creation.\n\nThe `ResourceGridMapper`, on the other hand, works closely with `ResourceGrid` taking as input a tensor of complex-valued data symbols and assigning them to the `ResourceGrid`. It's used as a pre-processing step before modulation using the `OFDMModulator` or any processing operation in the frequency domain.\n\nThis mapping process in `ResourceGridMapper` is crucial in Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems to ensure that data symbols are allocated to the right spaces in the resource grid for effective OFDM modulation.

The parameter cm_cell_size therefore controls the granularity of the map. The coverage map associates with every cell $(i,j)$ the quantity $b_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{\\lvert C \\rvert} \\int_{C_{i,j}} \\lvert h(s) \\rvert^2 ds$\nwhere $\\lvert h(s) \\rvert^2$ s the squared amplitude of the path coefficients $a_i$ at position $s=(x,y)$, the integral is over the cell $C_{i,j}$, and $ds$ is the infinitesimal small surface element $ds=dx \\cdot dy$. The dimension indexed by $i$($j$) corresponds to the $y\\, (x)$-axis of the coverage map in its local coordinate system.\n \nFor specularly and diffusely reflected paths, can be rewritten as an integral over the directions of departure of the rays from the transmitter, by substituting $s$ with the corresponding direction $\\omega$: $b_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{\\lvert C \\rvert} \\int_{\\Omega} \\lvert h\\left(s(\\omega) \\right) \\rvert^2 \\frac{r(\\omega)^2}{\\lvert \\cos{\\alpha(\\omega)} \\rvert} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{ s(\\omega) \\in C_{i,j} \\right\\}} d\\omega$\nwhere the integration is over the unit sphere $\\Omega$, $r(\\omega)$ is the length of the path with direction of departure $\\omega$, $s(\\omega)$ is the point where the path with direction of departure $\\omega$ intersects the coverage map, normal and the direction of arrival of the path with direction of departure $\\omega$, and $\\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{ s(\\omega) \\in C_{i,j} \\right\\}}$ is the function that takes as value one if $s(\\omega) \\in C_{i,j}$ and zero otherwise. Note that $ds = \\frac{r(\\omega)^2 d\\omega}{\\lvert \\cos{\\alpha(\\omega)} \\rvert}$\n\nThe previous integral is approximated through Monte Carlo sampling by shooting $N$ rays with directions $\\omega_n$ arranged as a Fibonacci lattice on the unit sphere around the transmitter, and bouncing the rays on the intersected objects until the maximum depth (max_depth) is reached or the ray bounces out of the scene. At every intersection with an object of the scene, a new ray is shot from the intersection which corresponds to either specular reflection or diffuse scattering, following a Bernoulli distribution with parameter the squared scattering coefficient. When diffuse scattering is selected, the direction of the scattered ray is uniformly sampled on the half-sphere. The resulting Monte Carlo estimate is:\n$\\hat{b}_{i,j}^{\\text{(ref)}} = \\frac{4\\pi}{N\\lvert C \\rvert} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\lvert h\\left(s(\\omega_n)\\right)  \\rvert^2 \\frac{r(\\omega_n)^2}{\\lvert \\cos{\\alpha(\\omega_n)} \\rvert} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{ s(\\omega_n) \\in C_{i,j} \\right\\}}.$\n\nFor the diffracted paths, can be rewritten for any wedge with length $L$ and opening angle $\\Phi$ as an integral over the wedge and its opening angle, by substituting $s$ with the position on the wedge $\\ell \\in [1,L]$ and the angle $\\phi \\in [0, \\Phi]$:\n$b_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{\\lvert C \\rvert} \\int_{\\ell} \\int_{\\phi} \\lvert h\\left(s(\\ell,\\phi) \\right) \\rvert^2 \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{ s(\\ell,\\phi) \\in C_{i,j} \\right\\}} \\left\\lVert \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial \\ell} \\times \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial \\phi} \\right\\rVert d\\ell d\\phi$ \nwhere the integral is over the wedge length $L$ and opening angle $\\Phi$, and $r\\left( \\ell, \\phi \\right)$ is the reparametrization with respected to $(\\ell, \\phi)$ of the intersection between the diffraction cone at $\\ell$ and the rectangle defining the coverage map (see, e.g., [Wikipedia, \u201cSurface integral\u201d, accessed Jun. 22, 2023.]). The previous integral is approximated through Monte Carlo sampling by shooting $N'$ rays from equally spaced locations $\\ell_n$ along the wedge with directions $\\phi_n$ sampled uniformly from $(0, \\Phi)$:\n$\\hat{b}_{i,j}^{\\text{(diff)}} = \\frac{L\\Phi}{N'\\lvert C \\rvert} \\sum_{n=1}^{N'} \\lvert h\\left(s(\\ell_n,\\phi_n)\\right) \\rvert^2 \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{ s(\\ell_n,\\phi_n) \\in C_{i,j} \\right\\}} \\left\\lVert \\left(\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial \\ell}\\right)_n \\times \\left(\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)_n \\right\\rVert.$\n\nThe output of this function is therefore a real-valued matrix of size [num_cells_y, num_cells_x], for every transmitter, with elements equal to the sum of the contributions of the reflected and scattered paths and diffracted paths for all the wedges, and where $\\begin{split}\\texttt{num_cells_x} = \\bigg\\lceil\\frac{\\texttt{cm_size[0]}}{\\texttt{cm_cell_size[0]}} \\bigg\\rceil\\\\\n\\texttt{num_cells_y} = \\bigg\\lceil \\frac{\\texttt{cm_size[1]}}{\\texttt{cm_cell_size[1]}} \\bigg\\rceil.\\end{split}$\n\nThe surface defining the coverage map is a rectangle centered at cm_center, with orientation cm_orientation, and with size cm_size. An orientation of (0,0,0) corresponds to a coverage map parallel to the XY plane, with surface normal pointing towards the $+z$ axis. By default, the coverage map is parallel to the XY plane, covers all of the scene, and has an elevation of $z = 1.5\\text{m}$. The receiver is assumed to use the antenna array scene.rx_array. If transmitter and/or receiver have multiple antennas, transmit precoding and receive combining are applied which are defined by precoding_vec and combining_vec, respectively.\n\nThe $(i,j)$ indices are omitted in the following for clarity. For reflection and scattering, paths are generated by shooting num_samples rays from the transmitters with directions arranged in a Fibonacci lattice on the unit sphere and by simulating their propagation for up to max_depth interactions with scene objects. If max_depth is set to 0 and if los is set to True, only the line-of-sight path is considered. For diffraction, paths are generated by shooting num_samples rays from equally spaced locations along the wedges in line-of-sight with the transmitter, with directions uniformly sampled on the diffraction cone.\n\nFor every ray $n$ intersecting the coverage map cell $(i,j)$, the channel coefficients, $a_n$, and the angles of departure (AoDs) $(\\theta_{\\text{T},n}, \\varphi_{\\text{T},n})$ and arrival (AoAs) $(\\theta_{\\text{R},n}, \\varphi_{\\text{R},n})$ are computed. See the [Primer on Electromagnetics](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/em_primer.html) for more details.\n\nA \u201csynthetic\u201d array is simulated by adding additional phase shifts that depend on the antenna position relative to the position of the transmitter (receiver) as well as the AoDs (AoAs). For the $k^\\text{th}$ transmit antenna and $\\ell^\\text{th}$ receive antenna, let us denote by $\\mathbf{d}_{\\text{T},k}$ and $\\mathbf{d}_{\\text{R},\\ell}$ the relative positions (with respect to the positions of the transmitter/receiver) of the pair of antennas for which the channel impulse response shall be computed. These can be accessed through the antenna array\u2019s property positions. Using a plane-wave assumption, the resulting phase shifts from these displacements can be computed as\n$\\begin{split}p_{\\text{T}, n,k} &= \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}(\\theta_{\\text{T},n}, \\varphi_{\\text{T},n})^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{d}_{\\text{T},k}\\\\\np_{\\text{R}, n,\\ell} &= \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}(\\theta_{\\text{R},n}, \\varphi_{\\text{R},n})^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{d}_{\\text{R},\\ell}.\\end{split}$\n\nThe final expression for the path coefficient is\n$h_{n,k,\\ell} =  a_n e^{j(p_{\\text{T}, i,k} + p_{\\text{R}, i,\\ell})}$\nfor every transmit antenna $k$ and receive antenna $\\ell$. These coefficients form the complex-valued channel matrix, $\\mathbf{H}_n$, of size $\\texttt{num_rx_ant} \\times \\texttt{num_tx_ant}$.\n\nFinally, the coefficient of the equivalent SISO channel is\n$h_n =  \\mathbf{c}^{\\mathsf{H}} \\mathbf{H}_n \\mathbf{p}$\nwhere $\\mathbf{c}$ and $\\mathbf{p}$ are the combining and precoding vectors (combining_vec and precoding_vec), respectively.\n\n**Example**\n```python\nimport sionna\nfrom sionna.rt import load_scene, PlanarArray, Transmitter, Receiver\nscene = load_scene(sionna.rt.scene.munich)\n\n# Configure antenna array for all transmitters\nscene.tx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=8,\n                        num_cols=2,\n                        vertical_spacing=0.7,\n                        horizontal_spacing=0.5,\n                        pattern=\"tr38901\",\n                        polarization=\"VH\")\n\n# Configure antenna array for all receivers\nscene.rx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=1,\n                        num_cols=1,\n                        vertical_spacing=0.5,\n                        horizontal_spacing=0.5,\n                        pattern=\"dipole\",\n                        polarization=\"cross\")\n# Add a transmitters\ntx = Transmitter(name=\"tx\",\n            position=[8.5,21,30],\n            orientation=[0,0,0])\nscene.add(tx)\ntx.look_at([40,80,1.5])\n\n# Compute coverage map\ncm = scene.coverage_map(cm_cell_size=[1.,1.],\n                    num_samples=int(10e6))\n\n# Visualize coverage in preview\nscene.preview(coverage_map=cm,\n            resolution=[1000, 600])\n```\n\n[Result](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/_images/coverage_map_preview.png)\n\n**Input Parameters**\n\n- `rx_orientation` ([3], float): Orientation of the receiver specified as three angles $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$ corresponding to a 3D rotation.

This involves sampling the channel model to build a set of frequency-domain channel realizations and then estimating the covariance matrices.\n\n3. Load the estimated covariance matrices and visualize them to understand the channel characteristics.\n\n4. Create a Keras model for the MIMO OFDM link. This model should include the transmitter, channel, and receiver components. The receiver should include the channel estimation and MIMO detection modules.\n\n5. Define a function to evaluate the mean square error (MSE) of the model over a range of SNRs. This function should run the model for each SNR value and compute the MSE.\n\n6. Run the simulations for the range of SNRs and store the results.\n\n7. Plot the results to visualize the performance of the MIMO detectors.\n\nHere is a simplified version of the code that might be used to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Define the simulation parameters\nNUM_OFDM_SYMBOLS = 14\nFFT_SIZE = 12*4 # 4 PRBs\nSUBCARRIER_SPACING = 30e3 # Hz\nCARRIER_FREQUENCY = 3.5e9 # Hz\nSPEED = 3. # m/s\n\n# Estimate the channel covariance matrices\nFREQ_COV_MAT, TIME_COV_MAT, SPACE_COV_MAT = estimate_covariance_matrices(batch_size, num_iterations)\n\n# Load the estimated covariance matrices\nFREQ_COV_MAT = np.load('freq_cov_mat.npy')\nTIME_COV_MAT = np.load('time_cov_mat.npy')\nSPACE_COV_MAT = np.load('space_cov_mat.npy')\n\n# Create the MIMO OFDM link model\ne2e = MIMOOFDMLink(\"symbol\", \"lmmse\", True, NUM_TX, NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL, det_param=None)\n\n# Define the range of SNRs and the batch size and number of iterations for the MSE evaluation\nSNR_DBs = np.linspace(-10.0, 20.0, 20)\nBATCH_SIZE = 512\nNUM_IT = 10\n\n# Evaluate the MSE for each SNR value\nMSES = evaluate_mse(e2e, SNR_DBs, BATCH_SIZE, NUM_IT)\n\n# Plot the results\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,6))\nfor est_label in MSES:\n    plt.semilogy(SNR_DBs, MSES[est_label], label=est_label)\nplt.xlabel(r\"SNR (dB)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"MSE\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified version of the code and may not work as is. You would need to define the `estimate_covariance_matrices` and `evaluate_mse` functions, and also ensure that all the necessary packages and modules are imported."}]}

Your proficiency in Sionna allows you to simulate and analyze various aspects of wireless communication systems effectively."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Describe the concept of all-zero codeword simulations and how it can be used to simulate accurate BER curves without an actual encoder."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All-zero codeword simulations are a method used in bit-error rate (BER) simulations to simplify the process and increase efficiency. The concept is based on the property of linear codes where each codeword has, on average, the same behavior. Therefore, for BER simulations, it is sufficient to use the all-zero codeword.\n\nIn the context of Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM), the all-zero codeword simulations allow for BER simulations without having an explicit Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) encoder available. This is achieved by transmitting constant zeros, which due to the symmetry of the modulation scheme (like QPSK), results in the same error-rates as any other sequence. \n\nHowever, for higher order modulation schemes like 16-QAM, a scrambler is required to ensure that the mapper/demapper operates on pseudo-random data, but from the decoder's perspective, the all-zero codeword assumption is still valid. This avoids the need for an actual encoder.\n\nIn the case of mismatched demapping, where the estimated Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) used for demapping can be inaccurate, min-sum decoding can be more robust and provide better performance.\n\nIn summary, all-zero codeword simulations provide a simplified and efficient method for simulating accurate BER curves without the need for an actual encoder. This is particularly useful in the design and analysis of communication systems."}]}

After initializing the model, you can access the decoder component of the model using `model.decoder`.\n\n3. The decoder object has a method called `show_weights()`. This method can be used to plot the weights of the decoder after initialization. You can call this method as follows: `model.decoder.show_weights()`.\n\nThis will display a histogram showing the distribution of the weights after initialization. \n\nPlease note that the actual code may vary depending on the specific implementation and the library used.

When the class is called, it translates these indices into their corresponding binary representations. The output of this class is a tensor of shape equal to the input shape but with an additional dimension corresponding to `num_bits_per_symbol`. Each element of the tensor is now a binary representation of the corresponding symbol index.\n\nIt's important to note that while the class performs a transformation from symbol indices to binary representations, it doesn't directly handle any form of modulation or demodulation process.

The model should return the binary cross entropy (BCE) loss.\n   - Compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the model's trainable weights.\n   - Apply the gradients to the model's weights using an optimizer.\n   - Repeat these steps for the specified number of training iterations.\n\n4. **Train the Model:** Instantiate the model and train it using the defined training loop.\n\n5. **Save the Model Weights:** After training, save the model weights for future use.\n\nHere is a simplified version of the training loop:\n\n```python\ndef conventional_training(model):\n    # Optimizer used to apply gradients\n    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()\n    for i in range(num_training_iterations_conventional):\n        # Sampling a batch of SNRs\n        ebno_db = tf.random.uniform(shape=[training_batch_size], minval=ebno_db_min, maxval=ebno_db_max)\n        # Forward pass\n        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:\n            loss = model(training_batch_size, ebno_db) # The model is assumed to return the BCE rate\n        # Computing and applying gradients\n        weights = model.trainable_weights\n        grads = tape.gradient(loss, weights)\n        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, weights))\n        # Printing periodically the progress\n        if i % 100 == 0:\n            print('Iteration {}/{}  BCE: {:.4f}'.format(i, num_training_iterations_conventional, loss.numpy()), end='\\r')\n```\n\nThis is a simplified explanation and the actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements of the autoencoder and the training process."}]}

It then discards any trailing symbols, removes the cyclic prefix from each piece and computes the `fft_size`-point discrete Fourier transform.

In 5G NR, one can configure many different pilot patterns to adapt to different channel conditions and to allow for spatial multiplexing of up to twelve layers. Each transmitted layer is identified by a DMRS port, i.e., a distinct pilot pattern.\n\nThe solution to the problem of interference between pilot sequences is the so-called code division multiplexing (CDM) groups in 5G NR. DMRS ports 0,1 belong to CDM group 0, while DMRS ports 2,3 belong to CDM group 1. The pilot signals belonging to the same CDM group are multiplied by orthogonal cover codes which allow separating them during channel estimation.\n\nThe parameter `NumCDMGroupsWithoutData` determines which resource elements in a DMRS-carrying OFDM symbol are masked for data transmissions. This is to avoid inference with pilots from other DMRS groups. In the given context, `NumCDMGroupsWithoutData` is set to two. This means that no data can be transmitted on any of the resource elements occupied by both DMRS groups. However, if we would have set `NumCDMGroupsWithoutData` equal to one, data and pilots would be frequency multiplexed.\n\nThe second parameter that controls the number of available DMRS ports is the `length`, which can be equal to either one or two. The pilot pattern is now composed of four 2x2 blocks within a PRB. These blocks are used by the four DMRS ports within the same CDM group. This means that we can now support up to twelve layers."}]}

This model should implement the end-to-end link and include components such as the channel, transmitter, and receiver.\n\n4. Run the simulation for different Eb/No values. You can use the `sim_ber` function from the Sionna library to simulate the Bit Error Rate (BER) and BLER for each Eb/No value. This function takes as input the link model, the range of Eb/No values, and other parameters such as the batch size and the maximum number of Monte Carlo iterations.\n\n5. Plot the BLER curve. Use matplotlib to plot the BLER values obtained from the simulation against the corresponding Eb/No values. You can use the `semilogy` function to create a semi-logarithmic plot, which is commonly used for BLER curves.\n\nHere is a simplified version of the code from the context that shows these steps:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.utils import sim_ber\n\n# Set up simulation parameters\nsim_params = {\n    \"ebno_db\": np.linspace(-7, -5.25, 10),\n    \"cyclic_prefix_length\" : 0,\n    \"pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices\" : [2, 11],\n}\n\n# Define the link model\nmodel = LinkModel(DeepMIMO_Sionna_adapter=DeepMIMO_Sionna_adapter,\n                  carrier_frequency=DeepMIMO_params['scenario_params']['carrier_freq'],\n                  cyclic_prefix_length=sim_params[\"cyclic_prefix_length\"],\n                  pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices=sim_params[\"pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices\"])\n\n# Run the simulation\nber, bler = sim_ber(model,\n                    sim_params[\"ebno_db\"],\n                    batch_size=batch_size,\n                    max_mc_iter=100,\n                    num_target_block_errors=100)\n\n# Plot the BLER curve\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,8))\nplt.xlabel(r\"$E_b/N_0$ (dB)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"BLER\")\nplt.grid(which=\"both\")\nplt.semilogy(sim_params[\"ebno_db\"], bler)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nPlease note that the `LinkModel` class is not defined in this simplified code.

The Hamming window is a specific type of window function used in signal processing for smoothing data. It is typically used in Fourier transform analysis to reduce the side lobe, or spectral leakage, effect.\n\nThe parameters for the HammingWindow class are:\n\n- `length`: which is an integer referring to the window length (number of samples).\n- `trainable`: a boolean value (default is False). If True, the window coefficients are trainable variables.\n- `normalize`: another boolean value (default is False). If True, the window is normalized to have unit average power per sample.\n- `dtype`: refers to the data type of the filter coefficients. It must be either tf.float32 or tf.float64.

For the `PolarSCLDecoder`, you will typically need to import the class from the Sionna library.\n\n   ```python\n   from sionna.fec.polar.decoding import PolarSCLDecoder\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine Frozen Positions**:\n   Determine the frozen bit positions, which are positions in the codeword that are set to known values (typically zeros) and are not used for transmitting information. Often this is done by using a predefined function or method. In Sionna, you can use the `generate_5g_ranking()` function if you want to align with 5G standards, which returns frozen and information bit positions based on the 3GPP specifications.\n\n   ```python\n   from sionna.fec.polar.utils import generate_5g_ranking\n   \n   k = ...  # Number of information bits\n   n = ...  # Codeword length\n   frozen_pos, info_pos = generate_5g_ranking(k, n)\n   ```\n\n   Make sure you replace the `k` and `n` with the actual values for your use case.\n\n3. **Create an Instance of `PolarSCLDecoder`**:\n   Instantiate the `PolarSCLDecoder` class by providing it with the necessary parameters, including the list size and the `frozen_pos`.\n\n   ```python\n   scl_decoder = PolarSCLDecoder(frozen_pos=frozen_pos, n=n, list_size=8, crc_degree=\"CRC24A\", return_crc_status=True)\n   ```\n\n   You will need to specify the `list_size` and `crc_degree` according to your requirements. Set `return_crc_status` to `True` if you want to obtain CRC status information after decoding.\n\n4. **Decode the LLR Values**:\n   Call the decoder instance by passing the received LLR values. The decoder will return the estimated information bits and, optionally, the CRC status.\n\n   ```python\n   llr_values = ...  # Obtained from demapping the received signal\n   estimated_bits, crc_status = scl_decoder(llr_values)\n   ```\n\n   Replace `llr_values` with your actual LLR values.\n\n5. **Process the CRC Status**:\n   After decoding, if `return_crc_status` was set to `True`, you now have the CRC status which indicates whether the codeword has been (most likely) correctly recovered. You can use this to reject codewords with failed CRC checks.\n\n   ```python\n   if crc_status:\n       print(\"Decoding successful and CRC check passed.\")\n   else:\n       print(\"Decoding failed or CRC check failed.\")\n   ```\n\n6. **Error Handling**:\n   Implement error handling to manage any potential exceptions or invalid parameters that could arise during the decoding process.\n\nRemember to always verify the specific configuration parameters (like `frozen_pos`, list size, and `crc_degree`) with the standards or specifications that your application adheres to. The above is a general guide, which should be adjusted according to specific context and requirements."}]}

If `encoder` is None, the above parameters must be provided explicitly.\n- `gen_poly` (tuple) \u2013 Tuple of strings with each string being a 0, 1 sequence. If None, `rate` and `constraint_length` must be provided.\n- `rate` (float) \u2013 Valid values are 1/3 and 1/2. Only required if `gen_poly` is None.\n- `constraint_length` (int) \u2013 Valid values are between 3 and 8 inclusive. Only required if `gen_poly` is None.\n- `rsc` (boolean) \u2013 Boolean flag indicating whether the encoder is recursive-systematic for given generator polynomials. True indicates the encoder is recursive-systematic. False indicates the encoder is feed-forward non-systematic.\n- `terminate` (boolean) \u2013 Boolean flag indicating whether the codeword is terminated. True indicates the codeword is terminated to an all-zero state. False indicates the codeword is not terminated.\n- `hard_out` (boolean) \u2013 Boolean flag indicating whether to output hard or soft decisions on the decoded information vector. True implies a hard-decoded information vector of 0/1\u2019s as output. False implies output is decoded LLR\u2019s of the information.\n- `algorithm` (str) \u2013 Defaults to `map`. Indicates the implemented BCJR algorithm, where `map` denotes the exact MAP algorithm, `log` indicates the exact MAP implementation, but in log-domain, and `maxlog` indicates the approximated MAP implementation in log-domain, where $\\log(e^{a}+e^{b}) \\sim \\max(a,b)$.\n- `output_dtype` (tf.DType) \u2013 Defaults to tf.float32. Defines the output datatype of the layer.\n\nInput\n\n- `llr_ch` or `(llr_ch, llr_a)` \u2013 Tensor or Tuple:\n    - `llr_ch` ([\u2026,n], tf.float32) \u2013 2+D tensor containing the (noisy) channel LLRs, where `n` denotes the codeword length.\n    - `llr_a` ([\u2026,k], tf.float32) \u2013 2+D tensor containing the a priori information of each information bit. Implicitly assumed to be 0 if only `llr_ch` is provided.\n\nOutput\n\n- `tf.float32` \u2013 2+D tensor of shape [\u2026,coderate*n] containing the estimates of the information bit tensor.\n\nProperties\n- `coderate`: Rate of the code used in the encoder.\n- `gen_poly`: Generator polynomial used by the encoder.\n- `k`: Number of information bits per codeword.\n- `n`: Number of codeword bits.\n- `terminate`: Indicates if the encoder is terminated during codeword generation.\n- `trellis`: Trellis object used during encoding."}]}

Import the necessary modules and configure your environment. This includes setting up your GPU configuration and importing Sionna. If Sionna is not already installed, you can install it using pip.\n\n2. Set up your transmission parameters. This includes the number of transmit and receive antennas, the number of bits per symbol, and the batch size.\n\n3. Generate a batch of random transmit vectors of random 16QAM symbols using the QAMSource function.\n\n4. Create an instance of the FlatFadingChannel class to simulate transmissions over a flat-fading channel. The channel will also add AWGN with variance `no`. \n\n5. Implement an LMMSE equalizer to compute soft-symbols using the perfect channel knowledge.\n\n6. Make hard decisions on the symbols and compute the SER using the SymbolDemapper and compute_ser functions.\n\n7. If you want to add spatial correlation to the FlatFadingChannel, you can do so using the SpatialCorrelation class. You can set up a Kronecker correlation model using exponential correlation matrices.\n\n8. To extend the simulation to channel coding, you need to generate random QAM symbols through mapping of coded bits. Then, transmit the symbols over the channel, demap the symbols to LLRs prior to decoding them.\n\n9. Finally, you can wrap everything in a Keras model for convenient BER simulations and comparison of model parameters. You can then instantiate different versions of this model and use the PlotBer class for easy Monte-Carlo simulations.\n\nRemember to use the appropriate Sionna APIs and ensure their exactness when implementing these steps."}]}

It is a type of interleaver, a telecommunications device that rearranges the order of bits in a data stream to combat burst errors during transmission.\n\nThis class is part of the `sionna.fec.interleaving` module and its construction can be used in the Keras model as a layer. The construction and usage would look something like this:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.interleaving import Turbo3GPPInterleaver \ninterleaver = Turbo3GPPInterleaver(axis=-1, inverse=False)\n```\n\nThe parameters of \"Turbo3GPPInterleaver\" are:\n\n- **`inverse`**: This is a boolean and defaults to `False`. If `True`, the inverse permutation is performed. In the context of interleaving, this generally means to reverse the operation of the interleaving process to return the data back to its original order.\n\n- **`axis`**: This parameter is an integer and defaults to `-1` which refers to the last axis. This specifies the dimension of the dataset that should be interleaved. The first dimension (`axis=0`) is not allowed in this case.\n\nPlease note that the maximum length of the \"Turbo3GPPInterleaver\" class is given as 6144 elements only for the dimension as specified by the `axis` parameter.\n\nOutput is a 2+D tensor of the same shape and dtype as the input. An error is raised if the `axis` is not an integer or if `axis` > number of input dimensions, or if `inverse` is not bool, or when rank(x)<2.\n\nThe class also contains functions `call_inverse()` for implementing the deinterleaver function corresponding to call() method and `find_s_min()` for finding optimized interleaver patterns.\n\nIt's important to note that this implementation slightly deviates from the 3GPP standard in a sense that zero-padding is introduced for cases when the exact interleaver length is not supported by the standard."}]}

Defines the initial state of the pseudo-random generator to generate the scrambling sequence. If None, a random integer will be generated. Only used when `keep_state` is True.\n  \n- **keep_batch_constant (bool)**: Defaults to False. If True, all samples in the batch are scrambled with the same scrambling sequence.

The size of the batch will depend on how many symbols you want to analyze.\n\n3. **Map the data to symbols**: Use the mapper to convert the binary data into complex-valued symbols.\n\n4. **Transmit the symbols over the channel**: Pass the symbols through the channel model.

By the context provided, it appears to be a part of the noise modelling in wireless communication systems. AWGN stands for Additive White Gaussian Noise, it's a basic noise model used in Information theory to mimic the effect of many random processes that occur in nature.\n\nThe models available include AWGN, flat-fading with optional SpatialCorrelation, RayleighBlockFading, as well as models from the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP protocol). It can also use externally generated Channel Impulse Responses (CIRs). \n\nAll of these models generate channel impulse responses (CIRs) that can then be used to implement a channel transfer function in the time domain or assuming an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveform. This is achieved using different functions, classes, and Keras layers which operate as shown in the figures in the original documentation.\n\nThe AWGN model is slightly different from the other models. While other models generate CIRs from scratch, the AWGN model documentation suggests that its setup methods may diverge from the others, although the context does not provide specific details on how to use the AWGN function or what parameters it takes. \n\nNote: Interpretation of the AWGN module is based on general knowledge about AWGN and may require confirmation from the specific Sionna's \"AWGN\" module documentation."}]}

Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Load the scene: You can load a scene using the `load_scene` function. For example, if you have a scene named `simple_street_canyon_with_cars`, you can load it as follows:\n\n```python\nscene = load_scene(sionna.rt.scene.simple_street_canyon_with_cars)\n```\n\n2. Access the scene objects: You can access the list of all scene objects using the `objects` property of the scene. For example:\n\n```python\nscene.objects\n```\n\n3. Inspect the position and orientation: Each object in the scene has a `position` and `orientation` property that can be inspected. For example, to inspect the position and orientation of a car named `car_2`, you can do the following:\n\n```python\ncar_2 = scene.get(\"car_2\")\nprint(\"Position: \", car_2.position.numpy())\nprint(\"Orientation: \", car_2.orientation.numpy())\n```\n\n4. Modify the position and orientation: You can modify the position and orientation of the scene objects. For example, to move the car `car_2` 10m along the y-axis and rotate it by 90 degrees around the z-axis, you can do the following:\n\n```python\ncar_2.position += [0, 10, 0]\ncar_2.orientation = [np.pi/2, 0, 0]\n```\n\nRemember that the position of an object corresponds to the center of its axis-aligned bounding box and by default, the orientation of every scene object is `[0,0,0]`.\n\nIn addition to controlling the position and orientation, you can also simulate the impact of movement of scene objects on the channel impulse response by assigning a velocity vector to the moving objects and computing the Doppler shift for a specific path. This can be done using the `velocity` property of the scene objects and the `apply_doppler` method of a `Paths` object."}]}

We have set its position at [200., 0.0, 50.] in the scene and also set its orientation to look at point [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. `scene.add(cam)` is used to add the camera to the scene. \n\nOnce you have configured a camera, you can use it to render a scene. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```python\nscene.render(cam)  # Render using the Camera instance\n```\nOr you can render the scene to a file:\n\n```python\nscene.render_to_file(cam)  # Render to a file using the Camera instance\n```\n\nThis will render the scene from the viewpoint of the camera `cam` that you have configured and added to your scene. \n\nRemember to first import the necessary modules and load a scene as follows:\n\n```python\n# import the necessary modules\nimport sionna.rt\n\n# load the scene\nscene = sionna.rt.load_scene(sionna.rt.scene.munich)\n```"}]}

Start by reviewing the [Sionna Ray Tracing Tutorial](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/examples/Sionna_Ray_Tracing_Introduction.html). This tutorial provides an introduction to the differentiable ray tracer and how it is used for radio propagation modeling.\n\n2. Acquaint yourself with background knowledge on electromagnetics, especially as utilized in the ray tracing module, by checking out the [Primer on Electromagnetics](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/em_primer.html).\n\n3. Learn about the key components in the ray tracer. The most crucial one is the `Scene`. The `Scene` has methods for the computation of propagation `Paths` (utilize [`compute_paths()`](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/rt.html#sionna.rt.Scene.compute_paths)) and `CoverageMap` (utilize [`coverage_map()`](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/rt.html#sionna.rt.Scene.coverage_map)). Get familiar with these methods as they are important for experiments.\n\n4. Look at the option to preview a scene in a Jupyter notebook using [`preview()`](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/rt.html#sionna.rt.Scene.preview). You can also render it to a file from the viewpoint of a camera using [`render()`](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/rt.html#sionna.rt.Scene.render) or [`render_to_file()`](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/rt.html#sionna.rt.Scene.render_to_file).\n\n5. Explore the integrated [Example Scenes](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/rt.html#example-scenes) available that can be used for testing and experiments.\n\n6. If you are interested in creating your own scene, watch this [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/7xHLDxUaQ7c), that explains how to create your own scenes using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org).\n\n7. Understand how Propagation `Paths` can be transformed into time-varying channel impulse responses (CIRs) via [`cir()`](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/rt.html#sionna.rt.Paths.cir). You can then use the CIRs for link-level simulations in Sionna.\n\n8. Refer to the paper [Sionna RT: Differentiable Ray Tracing for Radio Propagation Modeling](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/made_with_sionna.html#sionna-rt-differentiable-ray-tracing-for-radio-propagation-modeling) for in-depth information on how differentiable ray tracing can be utilized for various optimization tasks.\n\n9. Finally, study the antenna section to understand how antennas work with the ray tracer. Learn about `Antenna` and `AntennaArray` and functions like `compute_gain()` and `visualize()`, etc.\n\nBy following the above steps, you should be able to understand and start using the Sionna Ray Tracing module for radio propagation modeling. Remember to refer to the Sionna documentation for details about any functions or methods you're not familiar with."}]}

Set the environment variables \"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\" and 'TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL' using the `os.environ` method. The \"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\" variable determines which GPU will be used. The 'TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL' variable is used to control TensorFlow logging.\n\n3. Import the necessary modules. If the Sionna module is not installed, install it using pip.\n\n4. Configure TensorFlow to use only a single GPU and allocate only as much memory as needed. This can be done using the `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` method.\n\n5.

Compute the paths between the transmitter and all receivers. This can be done using the `compute_paths` function in the Sionna RT API. This function takes parameters such as the number of samples, and whether to include line-of-sight, reflection, diffraction, and scattering in the computation.\n\n```python\npaths = scene.compute_paths(num_samples=1e6,\n                            los=True,\n                            reflection=True,\n                            diffraction=True,\n                            scattering=False)\n```\n\n2.

This is done by summing all paths multiplied with their complex phase factors. The complex phase factor for each path is computed as `e^(-j2\u03c0\u03c4f)`, where `\u03c4` is the delay of the path, `f` is the frequency, and `j` is the imaginary unit. The amplitude `a` of each path is also included in the sum.\n\n```python\nh_f_tot = np.sum(a, axis=-1)\n```\n\n4. Finally, you can visualize the path gain `|H(f)|^2` for all receivers, i.e., as a function of the angle `\u03c6`.\n\n```python\nplt.plot(phi/PI*180, 20*np.log10(np.abs(h_f_tot)))\nplt.xlabel(\"Diffraction angle \u03c6 (deg)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Path gain |H(f)|^2 (dB)\")\nplt.ylim([-100, -59])\nplt.xlim([0, phi[-1]/PI*180])\n```\n\nThis will give you a plot of the path gain as a function of the diffraction angle.

What does the output represent, and how does it relate to the \"num_bitstreams\" property?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `get_num_term_syms` method from the `TurboTermination` class in the Sionna library is used to compute the number of termination symbols required for a Turbo code based on the parameters of the underlying convolutional code, with a particular focus on memory (`\u03bc`). When a convolutional code is terminated, additional bits, called termination symbols, are added to ensure that the encoder returns to a known state (typically the all-zero state). This is necessary to properly decode the transmitted message at the receiver end.\n\nThe output of `get_num_term_syms` is an integer (`turbo_term_syms`) that represents the total number of termination symbols required for the Turbo Code, where one symbol corresponds to the number of bits defined by the `num_bitstreams` property. \n\nThe `num_bitstreams` property, as it is described in the `TurboTermination` class, indicates the number of output bit streams from the Turbo code. This means that the Turbo code linearly maps information bits into multiple parallel bit streams. The `get_num_term_syms` method then uses the number of these bit streams to calculate how many Turbo code symbols will represent the termination bits.\n\nThe relationship between the output of `get_num_term_syms` and the `num_bitstreams` property can be understood as follows: the number of termination symbols depends on the number of bit streams (`num_bitstreams`) that are to be transmitted. If the Turbo code termination requires a certain number of termination bits, these bits are grouped into symbols, with each symbol containing `num_bitstreams` bits. Hence, the method computes how many such symbols are needed to encapsulate all the termination bits.\n\nThere is no direct code snippet provided in the context that invokes the `get_num_term_syms` method on a `TurboTermination` object, but typically its usage would resemble:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.turbo import TurboTermination\n\n# Initialize a TurboTermination object with desired parameters, you need to write your own parameters, here is just an example\nturbo_termination = TurboTermination(constraint_length=1, conv_n=2, num_conv_encs=2, num_bitstreams=8)\n\n\n# Compute the number of termination symbols required for the Turbo code\nnum_termination_symbols = turbo_termination.get_num_term_syms()\n```\n\nIn this hypothetical code, replace `...` with the actual parameter values as per the specific usage. Note that `constraint_length`, `conv_n`, `num_conv_encs`, and `num_bit_streams` are parameters that would be set based on the specifications of the Turbo code being implemented."}]}

Here is a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. First, load the scene that contains the object you want to modify. You can do this using the `load_scene` function from the `sionna.rt` module. For example:\n\n```python\nscene = load_scene(sionna.rt.scene.simple_street_canyon_with_cars)\n```\n\n2. Access the object you want to modify using the `get` method of the scene. For example, to access an object named \"car_2\", you would do:\n\n```python\ncar_2 = scene.get(\"car_2\")\n```\n\n3. You can now inspect the current position and orientation of the object using the `position` and `orientation` properties. For example:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Position: \", car_2.position.numpy())\nprint(\"Orientation: \", car_2.orientation.numpy())\n```\n\n4. To change the position and orientation of the object, you can simply assign new values to these properties. For example, to move the car 10m along the y-axis and rotate it by 90 degrees around the z-axis, you would do:\n\n```python\ncar_2.position += [0, 10, 0]\ncar_2.orientation = [np.pi/2, 0, 0]\n```\n\n5. If you want to visualize the changes, you can use the `preview` method of the scene. For example:\n\n```python\nscene.preview()\n```\n\nRemember that the position of an object corresponds to the center of its axis-aligned bounding box, and the orientation is specified as a rotation around each of the x, y, and z axes."}]}

You can raise this exception in your code where you want to stop the execution. Here is an example:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Your code here\n    ...\nexcept Exception as e:\n    raise ExitCell\n```\n\nIn this example, if an exception occurs in the try block, the except block will be executed. The `raise ExitCell` statement will stop the execution of the current cell."}]}

It is assumed that the measurements were taken at the nonzero positions of a PilotPattern.\n\nDepending on the value of order, the interpolation is carried out accross time (t), i.e., OFDM symbols, frequency (f), i.e., subcarriers, and optionally space (s), i.e., receive antennas, in any desired order.\n\nFor simplicity, we describe the underlying algorithm assuming that interpolation across the sub-carriers is performed first, followed by interpolation across OFDM symbols, and finally by spatial smoothing across receive antennas. The algorithm is similar if interpolation and/or smoothing are performed in a different order. For clarity, antenna indices are omitted when describing frequency and time interpolation, as the same process is applied to all the antennas.\n\nThe input h_hat is first reshaped to a resource grid $\\hat{\\mathbf{H}} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N \\times M}$, by scattering the channel estimates at pilot locations according to the pilot_pattern. $N$ denotes the number of OFDM symbols and $M$ the number of sub-carriers.\n\nThe first pass consists in interpolating across the sub-carriers: $\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_n^{(1)} = \\mathbf{A}_n \\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_n$ where $1 \\leq n \\leq N$ is the OFDM symbol index and $\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_n$ is the $n^{\\text{th}}$ transposed) row of $\\hat{\\mathbf{H}}$. $\\mathbf{A}_n$ is the $M \\times M$ matrix such that: $\\mathbf{A}_n = \\bar{\\mathbf{A}}_n \\mathbf{\\Pi}_n^\\intercal$ where $\\bar{\\mathbf{A}}_n = \\underset{\\mathbf{Z} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{M \\times K_n}}{\\text{argmin}} \\left\\lVert \\mathbf{Z}\\left( \\mathbf{\\Pi}_n^\\intercal \\mathbf{R^{(f)}} \\mathbf{\\Pi}_n + \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_n \\right) - \\mathbf{R^{(f)}} \\mathbf{\\Pi}_n \\right\\rVert_{\\text{F}}^2$ and $\\mathbf{R^{(f)}}$ is the $M \\times M$ channel frequency covariance matrix, $\\mathbf{\\Pi}_n$ the $M \\times K_n$ matrix that spreads $K_n$ values to a vector of size $M$ according to the pilot_pattern for the $n^{\\text{th}}$ OFDM symbol, and $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_n \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K_n \\times K_n}$ is the channel estimation error covariance built from err_var and assumed to be diagonal. Computation of $\\bar{\\mathbf{A}}_n$ is done using an algorithm based on complete orthogonal decomposition. This is done to avoid matrix inversion for badly conditioned covariance matrices.\n\nThe channel estimation error variances  after the first interpolation pass are computed as $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(1)}_n = \\text{diag} \\left( \\mathbf{R^{(f)}} - \\mathbf{A}_n \\mathbf{\\Xi}_n \\mathbf{R^{(f)}} \\right)$ where $\\mathbf{\\Xi}_n$ is the diagonal matrix of size $M \\times M$ that zeros the columns corresponding to sub-carriers not carrying any pilots. Note that interpolation is not performed for OFDM symbols which do not carry pilots.\n\nRemark: The interpolation matrix differs across OFDM symbols as different OFDM symbols may carry pilots on different sub-carriers and/or have different estimation error variances.\n\nScaling of the estimates is then performed to ensure that their variances match the ones expected by the next interpolation step, and the error variances are updated accordingly:\n$\\begin{split}\\begin{align}\n    \\left[\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_n^{(2)}\\right]_m &= s_{n,m} \\left[\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_n^{(1)}\\right]_m\\\\\n    \\left[\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(2)}_n\\right]_{m,m}  &= s_{n,m}\\left( s_{n,m}-1 \\right) \\left[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}^{(1)}_n\\right]_{m,m} + \\left( 1 - s_{n,m} \\right) \\left[\\mathbf{R^{(f)}}\\right]_{m,m} + s_{n,m} \\left[\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(1)}_n\\right]_{m,m}\n\\end{align}\\end{split}$\n\nwhere the scaling factor $s_{n,m}$ is such that:\n$\\mathbb{E} \\left\\{ \\left\\lvert s_{n,m} \\left[\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_n^{(1)}\\right]_m \\right\\rvert^2 \\right\\} = \\left[\\mathbf{R^{(f)}}\\right]_{m,m} +  \\mathbb{E} \\left\\{ \\left\\lvert s_{n,m} \\left[\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}^{(1)}_n\\right]_m - \\left[\\mathbf{h}_n\\right]_m \\right\\rvert^2 \\right\\}$\nwhich leads to:\n$\\begin{split}\\begin{align}\n    s_{n,m} &= \\frac{2 \\left[\\mathbf{R^{(f)}}\\right]_{m,m}}{\\left[\\mathbf{R^{(f)}}\\right]_{m,m} - \\left[\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(1)}_n\\right]_{m,m} + \\left[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}^{(1)}_n\\right]_{m,m}}\\\\\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}^{(1)}_n &= \\mathbf{A}_n \\mathbf{R^{(f)}} \\mathbf{A}_n^{\\mathrm{H}}.\n\\end{align}\\end{split}$\n\nThe second pass consists in interpolating across the OFDM symbols: $\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_m^{(3)} = \\mathbf{B}_m \\tilde{\\mathbf{h}}^{(2)}_m$ where $1 \\leq m \\leq M$ is the sub-carrier index and $\\tilde{\\mathbf{h}}^{(2)}_m$ is the $m^{\\text{th}}$ column of $\\begin{split}\\hat{\\mathbf{H}}^{(2)} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n                            {\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_1^{(2)}}^\\intercal\\\\\n                            \\vdots\\\\\n                            {\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_N^{(2)}}^\\intercal\n                         \\end{bmatrix}\\end{split}$\nand $\\mathbf{B}_m$ is the $N \\times N$ interpolation LMMSE matrix: $\\mathbf{B}_m = \\bar{\\mathbf{B}}_m \\tilde{\\mathbf{\\Pi}}_m^\\intercal$\nwhere\n$\\bar{\\mathbf{B}}_m = \\underset{\\mathbf{Z} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N \\times L_m}}{\\text{argmin}} \\left\\lVert \\mathbf{Z} \\left( \\tilde{\\mathbf{\\Pi}}_m^\\intercal \\mathbf{R^{(t)}}\\tilde{\\mathbf{\\Pi}}_m + \\tilde{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}^{(2)}_m \\right) -  \\mathbf{R^{(t)}}\\tilde{\\mathbf{\\Pi}}_m \\right\\rVert_{\\text{F}}^2$\nwhere $\\mathbf{R^{(t)}}$ is the $N \\times N$ channel time covariance matrix, $\\tilde{\\mathbf{\\Pi}}_m$ the $N \\times L_m$ matrix that spreads $L_m$ values to a vector of size $N$ according to the pilot_pattern for the $m^{\\text{th}}$ sub-carrier, and $\\tilde{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}^{(2)}_m \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L_m \\times L_m}$ is the diagonal matrix of channel estimation error variances built by gathering the error variances from $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(2)}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(2)}_N$ corresponding to resource elements carried by $m^{\\text{th}}$ the sub-carrier. Computation of $\\bar{\\mathbf{B}}_m$ is done using an algorithm based on complete orthogonal decomposition. This is done to avoid matrix inversion for badly conditioned covariance matrices.\n\nThe resulting channel estimate for the resource grid is $\\hat{\\mathbf{H}}^{(3)} = \\left[ \\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_1^{(3)} \\dots \\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_M^{(3)} \\right]$ The resulting channel estimation error variances are the diagonal coefficients of the matrices $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(3)}_m = \\mathbf{R^{(t)}} - \\mathbf{B}_m \\tilde{\\mathbf{\\Xi}}_m \\mathbf{R^{(t)}}, 1 \\leq m \\leq M$ where $\\tilde{\\mathbf{\\Xi}}_m$ is the diagonal matrix of size $N \\times N$ that zeros the columns corresponding to OFDM symbols not carrying any pilots.\n\nRemark: The interpolation matrix differs across sub-carriers as different sub-carriers may have different estimation error variances computed by the first pass. However, all sub-carriers carry at least one channel estimate as a result of the first pass, ensuring that a channel estimate is computed for all the resource elements after the second pass.\n\nRemark: LMMSE interpolation requires knowledge of the time and frequency covariance matrices of the channel. The notebook OFDM MIMO Channel Estimation and Detection shows how to estimate such matrices for arbitrary channel models. Moreover, the functions tdl_time_cov_mat() and tdl_freq_cov_mat() compute the expected time and frequency covariance matrices, respectively, for the TDL channel models.\n\nScaling of the estimates is then performed to ensure that their variances match the ones expected by the next smoothing step, and the error variances are updated accordingly:\n$\\begin{split}\\begin{align}\n    \\left[\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_m^{(4)}\\right]_n &= \\gamma_{m,n} \\left[\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_m^{(3)}\\right]_n\\\\\n    \\left[\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(4)}_m\\right]_{n,n}  &= \\gamma_{m,n}\\left( \\gamma_{m,n}-1 \\right) \\left[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}^{(3)}_m\\right]_{n,n} + \\left( 1 - \\gamma_{m,n} \\right) \\left[\\mathbf{R^{(t)}}\\right]_{n,n} + \\gamma_{m,n} \\left[\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(3)}_n\\right]_{m,m}\n\\end{align}\\end{split}$\nwhere:\n$\\begin{split}\\begin{align}\n    \\gamma_{m,n} &= \\frac{2 \\left[\\mathbf{R^{(t)}}\\right]_{n,n}}{\\left[\\mathbf{R^{(t)}}\\right]_{n,n} - \\left[\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(3)}_m\\right]_{n,n} + \\left[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}^{(3)}_n\\right]_{m,m}}\\\\\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}^{(3)}_m &= \\mathbf{B}_m \\mathbf{R^{(t)}} \\mathbf{B}_m^{\\mathrm{H}}\n\\end{align}\\end{split}$\nFinally, a spatial smoothing step is applied to every resource element carrying a channel estimate. For clarity, we drop the resource element indexing $(n,m)$. We denote by $L$ the number of receive antennas, and by $\\mathbf{R^{(s)}}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{L \\times L}$ the spatial covariance matrix.\n\nLMMSE spatial smoothing consists in the following computations: \n$\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}^{(5)} = \\mathbf{C} \\hat{\\mathbf{h}}^{(4)}$\nwhere\n$\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{R^{(s)}} \\left( \\mathbf{R^{(s)}} + \\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(4)} \\right)^{-1}.$\nThe estimation error variances are the digonal coefficients of\n$\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(5)} = \\mathbf{R^{(s)}} - \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{R^{(s)}}$\n\nThe smoothed channel estimate $\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}^{(5)}$ and corresponding error variances $\\text{diag}\\left( \\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(5)} \\right)$ are returned for every resource element $(m,n)$.\n\nRemark: No scaling is performed after the last interpolation or smoothing step.\n\nRemark: All passes assume that the estimation error covariance matrix ($\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$, $\\tilde{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}^{(2)}$, or $\\tilde{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}^{(4)}$) is diagonal, which may not be accurate. When this assumption does not hold, this interpolator is only an approximation of LMMSE interpolation.\n\nRemark: The order in which frequency interpolation, temporal interpolation, and, optionally, spatial smoothing are applied, is controlled using the order parameter.\n\n**Note:** This layer does not support graph mode with XLA.\n\n**Parameters**\n\n- `pilot_pattern` (PilotPattern): An instance of PilotPattern.\n- `cov_mat_time` ([num_ofdm_symbols, num_ofdm_symbols], tf.complex): Time covariance matrix of the channel.\n- `cov_mat_freq` ([fft_size, fft_size], tf.complex): Frequency covariance matrix of the channel.\n- `cov_time_space` ([num_rx_ant, num_rx_ant], tf.complex): Spatial covariance matrix of the channel. Defaults to None. Only required if spatial smoothing is requested (see order).\n- `order` (str): Order in which to perform interpolation and optional smoothing. For example, \"t-f-s\" means that interpolation across the OFDM symbols is performed first (\"t\": time), followed by interpolation across the sub-carriers (\"f\": frequency), and finally smoothing across the receive antennas (\"s\": space). Similarly, \"f-t\" means interpolation across the sub-carriers followed by interpolation across the OFDM symbols and no spatial smoothing. The spatial covariance matrix (cov_time_space) is only required when spatial smoothing is requested. Time and frequency interpolation are not optional to ensure that a channel estimate is computed for all resource elements.\n\n**Input**\n\n- `h_hat` ([batch_size, num_rx, num_rx_ant, num_tx, num_streams_per_tx, num_pilot_symbols], tf.complex): Channel estimates for the pilot-carrying resource elements.\n- `err_var` ([batch_size, num_rx, num_rx_ant, num_tx, num_streams_per_tx, num_pilot_symbols], tf.complex): Channel estimation error variances for the pilot-carrying resource elements.\n\n**Output**\n\n- `h_hat` ([batch_size, num_rx, num_rx_ant, num_tx, num_streams_per_tx, num_ofdm_symbols, fft_size], tf.complex): Channel estimates across the entire resource grid for all transmitters and streams.\n- `err_var` (Same shape as h_hat, tf.float): Channel estimation error variances across the entire resource grid for all transmitters and streams."}]}

This model will generate batches of random realizations of continuous-time channel impulse responses.\n\n5. **Generate the Channel Frequency Response**: Convert the continuous-time channel impulse response to the frequency domain using the `cir_to_ofdm_channel` function. This function computes the Fourier transform of the continuous-time channel impulse response at a set of frequencies, corresponding to the different subcarriers.\n\n6. **Transmit Data**: Generate batches of information bits, encode them, map them to constellation symbols, and map these symbols onto an OFDM resource grid. If you are simulating a downlink transmission, you will also need to precode the transmit signal in the frequency domain.\n\n7. **Apply the Channel**: Apply the channel frequency response to the input signal using the `ApplyOFDMChannel` layer. This layer can also add additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) to the channel output.\n\n8. **Receive and Decode Data**: At the receiver, estimate the channel using the `LSChannelEstimator` object and apply MIMO equalization using the `LMMSEEqualizer` object.

The tensor must be a complex tensor.\n2. `axis` - This is an optional parameter that outlines the dimension along which the DFT will be computed.

In the context, it is defined as `DELAY_SPREAD = 100e-9`.\n\n2. **Define the Direction**: The direction determines if the UT or BS is transmitting. In the `uplink`, the UT is transmitting. It is defined as `DIRECTION = \"uplink\"`.\n\n3. **Define the CDL Model**: The CDL model is defined using the `sn.channel.tr38901.CDL` function. The CDL model is chosen as \"C\" in the context, defined as `CDL_MODEL = \"C\"`.\n\n4. **Define the Speed**: The speed of the UT is defined as `SPEED = 10.0`. The BSs are always assumed to be fixed. The direction of travel will be chosen randomly within the x-y plane.\n\n5. **Implement the CDL Model**: The CDL model is implemented using the `sn.channel.tr38901.CDL` function. The function takes the CDL model, delay spread, carrier frequency, UT array, BS array, direction, and minimum speed as parameters. The function is used to generate batches of random realizations of continuous-time channel impulse responses, consisting of complex gains `a` and delays `tau` for each path.\n\nHere is the code snippet from the context:\n\n```python\nDELAY_SPREAD = 100e-9 \nDIRECTION = \"uplink\"  \nCDL_MODEL = \"C\"       \nSPEED = 10.0          \nCDL = sn.channel.tr38901.CDL(CDL_MODEL,\n                             DELAY_SPREAD,\n                             CARRIER_FREQUENCY,\n                             UT_ARRAY,\n                             BS_ARRAY,\n                             DIRECTION,\n                             min_speed=SPEED)\n```\n\n6. **Simulate the Transmission**: The transmission is simulated using the `OFDMSystem` class. The class takes a boolean parameter that enables using either LS estimation or perfect CSI. The class uses the binary source, encoder, mapper, resource grid mapper, frequency domain channel, LS channel estimator, LMMSE equalizer, demapper, and decoder to simulate the transmission.\n\nPlease note that the above steps are based on the provided context and may vary depending on the specific requirements of your implementation."}]}

Then, the QR decomposition of the\n    resulting channel matrix is computed:\n\n    .. math::\n        \\tilde{\\mathbf{H}} = \\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{R}\n\n    where :math:`\\mathbf{Q}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{M\\times S}` is unitary and\n    :math:`\\mathbf{R}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{S\\times S}` is upper-triangular.\n    The channel outputs are then pre-multiplied by :math:`\\mathbf{Q}^{\\mathsf{H}}`.\n    This leads to the final channel model on which the K-Best detection algorithm operates:\n\n    .. math::\n        \\bar{\\mathbf{y}} = \\mathbf{R}\\bar{\\mathbf{x}} + \\bar{\\mathbf{n}}\n\n    where :math:`\\bar{\\mathbf{y}}\\in\\mathbb{C}^S`,\n    :math:`\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}\\in\\mathbb{C}^S`, and :math:`\\bar{\\mathbf{n}}\\in\\mathbb{C}^S`\n    with :math:`\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\bar{\\mathbf{n}}\\right]=\\mathbf{0}` and\n    :math:`\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\bar{\\mathbf{n}}\\bar{\\mathbf{n}}^{\\mathsf{H}}\\right]=\\mathbf{I}`.\n\n    **LLR Computation**\n\n    The K-Best algorithm produces :math:`K` candidate solutions :math:`\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_k\\in\\mathcal{C}^S`\n    and their associated distance metrics :math:`d_k=\\lVert \\bar{\\mathbf{y}} - \\mathbf{R}\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_k \\rVert^2`\n    for :math:`k=1,\\dots,K`. If the real-valued channel representation is used, the distance\n    metrics are scaled by 0.5 to account for the reduced noise power in each complex dimension.\n    A hard-decision is simply the candidate with the shortest distance.\n    Various ways to compute LLRs from this list (and possibly\n    additional side-information) are possible. The (sub-optimal) default solution\n    is :class:`~sionna.mimo.List2LLRSimple`. Custom solutions can be provided.\n\n    Parameters\n    -----------\n    output : One of [\"bit\", \"symbol\"], str\n        The type of output, either bits or symbols. Whether soft- or\n        hard-decisions are returned can be configured with the\n        ``hard_out`` flag.\n\n    num_streams : tf.int\n        Number of transmitted streams\n\n    k : tf.int\n        The number of paths to keep. Cannot be larger than the\n        number of constellation points to the power of the number of\n        streams.\n\n    constellation_type : One of [\"qam\", \"pam\", \"custom\"], str\n        For \"custom\", an instance of :class:`~sionna.mapping.Constellation`\n        must be provided.\n\n    num_bits_per_symbol : int\n        The number of bits per constellation symbol, e.g., 4 for QAM16.\n        Only required for ``constellation_type`` in [\"qam\", \"pam\"].\n\n    constellation : Constellation\n        An instance of :class:`~sionna.mapping.Constellation` or `None`.\n        In the latter case, ``constellation_type``\n        and ``num_bits_per_symbol`` must be provided.\n\n    hard_out : bool\n        If `True`, the detector computes hard-decided bit values or\n        constellation point indices instead of soft-values.\n        Defaults to `False`. The detector cannot compute soft-symbols.\n\n    use_real_rep : bool\n        If `True`, the detector use the real-valued equivalent representation\n        of the channel. Note that this only works with a QAM constellation.\n        Defaults to `False`.\n\n    list2llr: `None` or instance of :class:`~sionna.mimo.List2LLR`\n        The function to be used to compute LLRs from a list of candidate solutions.\n        If `None`, the default solution :class:`~sionna.mimo.List2LLRSimple`\n        is used.\n\n    dtype : One of [tf.complex64, tf.complex128] tf.DType (dtype)\n        The dtype of ``y``. Defaults to tf.complex64.\n        The output dtype is the corresponding real dtype (tf.float32 or tf.float64).\n\n    Input\n    -----\n    (y, h, s) :\n        Tuple:\n\n    y : [...,M], tf.complex\n        1+D tensor containing the received signals\n\n    h : [...,M,num_streams], tf.complex\n        2+D tensor containing the channel matrices\n\n    s : [...,M,M], tf.complex\n        2+D tensor containing the noise covariance matrices\n\n    Output\n    ------\n    One of:\n\n    : [...,num_streams,num_bits_per_symbol], tf.float\n        LLRs or hard-decisions for every bit of every stream, if ``output`` equals `\"bit\"`\n\n    : [...,num_streams,2**num_points], tf.float or [...,num_streams], tf.int\n       Logits or hard-decisions for constellation symbols for every stream, if ``output`` equals `\"symbol\"`\n       Hard-decisions correspond to the symbol indices.\n\n    Note\n    ----\n    If you want to use this layer in Graph mode with XLA, i.e., within\n    a function that is decorated with ``@tf.function(jit_compile=True)``,\n    you must set ``sionna.Config.xla_compat=true``.\n    See :py:attr:`~sionna.Config.xla_compat`.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self,\n                 output,\n                 num_streams,\n                 k,\n                 constellation_type=None,\n                 num_bits_per_symbol=None,\n                 constellation=None,\n                 hard_out=False,\n                 use_real_rep=False,\n                 list2llr=\"default\",\n                 dtype=tf.complex64,\n                 **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(dtype=dtype, **kwargs)\n        assert dtype in [tf.complex64, tf.complex128],\\\n            \"dtype must be tf.complex64 or tf.complex128.\"\n\n        assert output in (\"bit\", \"symbol\"), \"Unknown output\"\n\n        err_msg = \"You must provide either constellation or \" + \\\n                  \"constellation_type and num_bits_per_symbol.\"\n        if constellation is None:\n            assert constellation_type is not None and \\\n                   num_bits_per_symbol is not None, err_msg\n        else:\n            assert constellation_type is None and \\\n                   num_bits_per_symbol is None, err_msg\n\n        if constellation is not None:\n            assert constellation.points.dtype==dtype, \\\n                \"Constellation has wrong dtype.\"\n\n        self._output = output\n        self._hard_out = hard_out\n        self._use_real_rep = use_real_rep\n\n        if self._use_real_rep:\n            #

Since `gen_poly` is not provided in the context, I'll demonstrate the creation using `rate` and `constraint_length` assuming they have been defined or chosen based on the requirements of the convolutional code you're working with:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.conv import ConvEncoder, BCJRDecoder\n\n# Create a ConvEncoder instance\nencoder = ConvEncoder(rate=1/2, constraint_length=3)\n\n# Now create a BCJRDecoder instance using the encoder object\nbcjr_decoder_with_encoder = BCJRDecoder(encoder=encoder, algorithm=\"map\")\n```\n\n2. **Using `gen_poly` and `algorithm` directly:**\n\nIf you already know the generator polynomials for the convolutional code, you can provide them directly to the `BCJRDecoder` along with the selection of the decoding algorithm (`algorithm`). For a rate-1/2 code with a constraint length of 3, the generator polynomials might be, for example, `['101', '111']`. Here's how you would create the `BCJRDecoder` using these parameters:\n\n```python\n# Assuming gen_poly is known\ngen_poly = ['101', '111']\n\n# Create a BCJRDecoder instance with gen_poly and algorithm directly\nbcjr_decoder_with_gen_poly = BCJRDecoder(gen_poly=gen_poly, algorithm=\"map\")\n```\n\nIn both initialization methods, the `algorithm` parameter is set to `\"map\"` as an example. You could replace `\"map\"` with another supported algorithm like `\"log\"` or `\"maxlog\"` depending on the specifics of the BCJR algorithm you wish to employ. Make sure to confirm that the `gen_poly` is accurate for the convolutional code you're dealing with.\n\nFor a complete setup, ensure that `rate` and `constraint_length` align with what's defined in 'gen_poly' if provided directly, or ensure they are set correctly when initializing the `ConvEncoder`. Also, ensure that the other properties (like termination and recursion) of the encoder and decoder match the specifications of the code if they are being set manually."}]}

This is similar to how light reflects off a mirror. The angle at which the wave hits the surface (the angle of incidence) is equal to the angle at which it bounces off (the angle of reflection).\n\nRefraction, on the other hand, is the change in direction of a wave as it passes from one medium to another. This is caused by a change in the wave's speed. For example, when light passes from air into water, it slows down and bends towards the normal (the line perpendicular to the surface). The amount of bending, or refraction, depends on the angles of incidence and the refractive indices of the two media.\n\nWhen a plane wave hits a plane interface (the boundary between two different media), both reflection and refraction can occur. The incident wave can split into a reflected wave and a refracted wave. The reflected wave remains in the original medium, while the refracted wave moves into the second medium. The directions of these waves are determined by the laws of reflection and refraction (Snell's law).\n\nIn the context of wireless propagation modelling, understanding reflection and refraction is crucial for predicting how signals will propagate, especially in complex environments with multiple interfaces and obstacles."}]}

This method attempts to allocate only as much GPU memory as needed for the runtime allocations. It starts out allocating very little memory, and as the program gets run and more GPU memory is needed, TensorFlow extends the GPU memory region allocated to the TensorFlow process. \n\nHere are the steps to set the GPU memory growth:\n\n1. Import the TensorFlow library using `import tensorflow as tf`.\n\n2. List the physical devices available for TensorFlow to use, specifically the GPUs, using `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')`. This will return a list of all available GPUs.\n\n3. Check if any GPUs are available using an if condition `if gpus:`.\n\n4. If GPUs are available, set the memory growth for the first GPU (or any specific GPU you want to configure) using `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)`. The first argument is the specific GPU, and the second argument is a boolean that needs to be set to `True` to enable memory growth.\n\n5. You can put this inside a try-except block to catch and print any runtime errors.\n\nHere is the code snippet from the context:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\nIn this code, `gpus[0]` refers to the first GPU. If you want to set memory growth for all available GPUs, you can loop over `gpus` and call `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` for each GPU."}]}

It is based on ray-tracing and takes as input a set of parameters such as antenna array configurations and time-domain/OFDM parameters. Based on these parameters and a selected ray-tracing scenario, the dataset generates MIMO channel realizations, corresponding locations, angles of arrival/departure, and more.\n\nThe DeepMIMO dataset can be used in various scenarios. For instance, in the provided context, it is used in the O1 scenario with the carrier frequency set to 60 GHz (O1_60). The dataset is generated to contain channels for different locations of the users and base stations. In this example, the dataset consists of channels for the links from base station 6 to the users located on the rows 400 to 450. Each of these rows consists of 181 user locations, resulting in 9231 base station-user channels.\n\nThe DeepMIMO dataset is also adaptable to be consistent with Sionna, a Python package for simulating wireless communication systems. An adapter is instantiated for a given DeepMIMO dataset, which takes the indices of the base stations and users, to generate the channels between these base stations and users. This adapter can be used to randomly sample channels from all the available user locations considering a certain number of users.\n\nThe DeepMIMO dataset is used in link-level simulations using Sionna. In this context, a Sionna model is defined implementing the end-to-end link. The model includes components forming the link such as codeword length, OFDM channel, transmitter, and receiver. The setup is then evaluated with different Eb/N0 values to obtain BLER curves.\n\nTo use the DeepMIMO dataset, it is important to check the license information. The dataset is cited as \"DeepMIMO: A Generic Deep Learning Dataset for Millimeter Wave and Massive MIMO Applications\" by Alkhateeb, in Proc. of Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA), San Diego, CA, Feb.2019."}]}

Your proficiency in Sionna allows you to simulate and analyze various aspects of wireless communication systems effectively."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please give me an overview of Radio Materials in Sionna."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " A RadioMaterial contains everything that is needed to enable the simulation of the interaction of a radio wave with an object made of a particular material. More precisely, it consists of the real-valued relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_r$, the conductivity $\\sigma$, and the relative permeability $\\mu_r$. For more details, see [(7)](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/em_primer.html#equation-epsilon), [(8)](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/em_primer.html#equation-mu), [(9)](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/em_primer.html#equation-eta). These quantities can possibly depend on the frequency of the incident radio wave. Note that Sionna currently only allows non-magnetic materials with $\\mu_r=1$.\n\nAdditionally, a RadioMaterial can have an effective roughness (ER) associated with it, leading to diffuse reflections (see, e.g., [Vittorio Degli-Esposti et al., \u201cAnalysis and Modeling on co- and Cross-Polarized Urban Radio Propagation for Dual-Polarized MIMO Wireless Systems\u201d, IEEE Trans. Antennas Propag, vol. 59, no. 11, pp.4247-4256, Nov. 2011.]). The ER model requires a scattering coefficient $S\\in[0,1]$[(37)](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/em_primer.html#equation-scattering-coefficient), a cross-polarization discrimination coefficient $K_x$[(39)](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/em_primer.html#equation-xpd), as well as a scattering pattern $f_\\text{s}(\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_\\text{i}, \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_\\text{s})$[(40)](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/em_primer.html#equation-lambertian-model)\u2013[(42)](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/em_primer.html#equation-backscattering-model), such as the LambertianPattern or DirectivePattern. The meaning of these parameters is explained in [Scattering](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/em_primer.html#scattering).\n\nSimilarly to scene objects (SceneObject), all radio materials are uniquely identified by their name. For example, specifying that a scene object named \u201cwall\u201d is made of the material named \u201citu-brick\u201d is done as follows:\n```python\nobj = scene.get(\"wall\") # obj is a SceneObject\nobj.radio_material = \"itu_brick\" # \"wall\" is made of \"itu_brick\"\n```\n\nSionna provides the [ITU models of several materials](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/rt.html#provided-materials) whose properties are automatically updated according to the configured frequency. It is also possible to [define custom radio materials](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/rt.html#custom-radio-materials).\n\n**Radio materials provided with Sionna**\n\nSionna provides the models of all of the materials defined in the ITU-R P.2040-2 recommendation [ITU-R, \u201cEffects of building materials and structures on radiowave propagation above about 100 MHz\u201c, Recommendation ITU-R P.2040-2]. These models are based on curve fitting to measurement results and assume non-ionized and non-magnetic materials ($\\mu_r = 1$). Frequency dependence is modeled by\n$\\begin{split}\\begin{align}\n   \\varepsilon_r &= a f_{\\text{GHz}}^b\\\\\n   \\sigma &= c f_{\\text{GHz}}^d\n\\end{align}\\end{split}$\nwhere $f_{\\text{GHz}}$ is the frequency in GHz, and the constants $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ characterize the material.

Note that only non-magnetic materials with $\\mu_r=1$ are currently allowed. The following code snippet shows how to create a custom radio material.\n\n```python\nload_scene() # Load empty scene\ncustom_material = RadioMaterial(\"my_material\",\n                                relative_permittivity=2.0,\n                                conductivity=5.0,\n                                scattering_coefficient=0.3,\n                                xpd_coefficient=0.1,\n                                scattering_pattern=LambertianPattern())\n```\n\nIt is also possible to define the properties of a material through a callback function that computes the material properties $(\\varepsilon_r, \\sigma)$ from the frequency:\n```python\ndef my_material_callback(f_hz):\n   relative_permittivity = compute_relative_permittivity(f_hz)\n   conductivity = compute_conductivity(f_hz)\n   return (relative_permittivity, conductivity)\n\ncustom_material = RadioMaterial(\"my_material\",\n                                frequency_update_callback=my_material_callback)\nscene.add(custom_material)\n```\n\nOnce defined, the custom material can be assigned to a SceneObject using its name:\n```python\nobj = scene.get(\"my_object\") # obj is a SceneObject\nobj.radio_material = \"my_material\" # \"my_object\" is made of \"my_material\"\n```\n\nor the material instance:\n```python\nobj = scene.get(\"my_object\") # obj is a SceneObject\nobj.radio_material = custom_material # \"my_object\" is made of \"my_material\"\n```\n\nThe material parameters can be assigned to TensorFlow variables or tensors, such as the output of a Keras layer defining a neural network. This allows one to make materials trainable:\n```python\nmat = RadioMaterial(\"my_mat\",\n                    relative_permittivity= tf.Variable(2.1, dtype=tf.float32))\nmat.conductivity = tf.Variable(0.0, dtype=tf.float32)\n```"}]}

Here's a general step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries:\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n```\n\n2. Prepare the data that you want to plot. In this case, you might want to plot the Mean Square Error (MSE), Symbol Error Rate (SER), or Bit Error Rate (BER) against the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). These data should be stored in lists or arrays. For example:\n```python\nSNR_DBs = np.linspace(-10.0, 20.0, 20)  # SNR values\nMSEs = [...]  # list of MSE values\nSERs = [...]  # list of SER values\nBERs = [...]  # list of BER values\n```\n\n3. Use the `plt.plot()` or `plt.semilogy()` function to create the plot. The first argument is the x-values and the second argument is the y-values. You can also add a label for each plot:\n```python\nplt.semilogy(SNR_DBs, MSEs, label='MSE')\nplt.semilogy(SNR_DBs, SERs, label='SER')\nplt.semilogy(SNR_DBs, BERs, label='BER')\n```\n\n4. Add labels to the x-axis and y-axis, and a title to the plot:\n```python\nplt.xlabel('SNR (dB)')\nplt.ylabel('Error Rate')\nplt.title('Performance of MIMO OFDM System')\n```\n\n5. Add a legend to the plot:\n```python\nplt.legend()\n```\n\n6. Display the plot:\n```python\nplt.show()\n```\n\nPlease replace the [...] with the actual data from your simulations. The code snippets provided in the context, such as `SER[\\'Perf. CSI / LMMSE\\']`, `BER[\\'Perf. CSI / LMMSE\\']`, etc., seem to be the results of the simulations that you might want to plot."}]}

It is important to note that this function requires the parity-check matrix (pcm) to have full rank, if it does not an error is raised.

This class generates channel frequency responses and applies them to channel inputs assuming an OFDM waveform with no Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) nor Intersymbol Interference (ISI).\n\nThe `RayleighBlockFading` class generates channel impulse responses for a Rayleigh block fading channel model, simulating random channel variations. The `GenerateOFDMChannel` class can then compute the frequency response of the channel from these impulse responses. These channel frequency responses can be applied to the channel inputs by using the `ApplyOFDMChannel` class.\n\nThere are some limitations to be aware of. It should be noted that the model implemented in the `OFDMChannel` class does not consider ICI nor ISI. This may limit its performance under scenarios with a significant amount of ICI or ISI, such as fast mobility or a long delay spread. Also, OFDM itself is sensitive to frequency offset and phase noise.\n\nIt's also important to mention that despite the fact context specifies the usage of Sionna APIs, practical implementation of these functionalities may also require considerations on system parameters such as bandwidth, number of OFDM symbols, FFT size, and noise variance among others."}]}

Fossorier, S. Lin, \u201cSoft-Decision Decoding of Linear Block Codes Based on Ordered Statistics\u201d, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 41, no.5, 1995.] and, thereby, approximates maximum likelihood decoding for a sufficiently large order t. The algorithm works for arbitrary linear block codes, but has a high computational complexity for long codes.\n\nThe algorithm consists of the following steps:\n\n    1. Sort LLRs according to their reliability and apply the same column permutation to the generator matrix.\n\n    2. Bring the permuted generator matrix into its systematic form (so-called most-reliable basis).\n\n    3. Hard-decide and re-encode the k most reliable bits and discard the remaining $n-k$ received positions.\n\n4. Generate all possible error patterns up to t errors in the k most reliable positions find the most likely codeword within these candidates.\n\nThis implementation of the OSD algorithm uses the LLR-based distance metric from [A.Balatsoukas-Stimming, M. Parizi, A. Burg, \u201cLLR-Based Successive Cancellation List Decoding of Polar Codes.\u201d IEEE Trans Signal Processing, 2015.] which simplifies the handling of higher-order modulation schemes.\n\nThe class inherits from the Keras layer class and can be used as layer in a Keras model.  \n  \n### Parameters\n\n- **enc_mat** ([k, n] or [n-k, n], ndarray): Binary generator matrix of shape [k, n]. If `is_pcm` is `True`, `enc_mat` is interpreted as parity-check matrix of shape [n-k, n].\n\n- **t** (int): Order of the OSD algorithm.\n\n- **is_pcm** (bool): Defaults to `False`. If `True`, `enc_mat` is interpreted as a parity-check matrix.\n\n- **encoder** (Layer): Keras layer that implements a FEC encoder. If not `None`, `enc_mat` will be ignored and the code as specified by the encoder is used to initialize OSD.\n\n- **dtype** (tf.DType): Defaults to `tf.float32`. Defines the datatype for the output dtype.\n\n### Input\n\n- **llrs_ch** ([\u2026,n], tf.float32): 2+D tensor containing the channel logits/llr values.\n\n### Output\n\n- **[\u2026,n], tf.float32**: 2+D Tensor of the same shape as `llrs_ch` containing binary hard-decisions of all codeword bits.\n  \n**Note: **  \nOS decoding is of high complexity and is only feasible for small values of t as ${n \\choose t}$ patterns must be evaluated. The advantage of OSD is that it works for arbitrary linear block codes and provides an estimate of the expected ML performance for sufficiently large t. However, for some code families, more efficient decoding algorithms with close to ML performance exist which can exploit certain code specific properties. Examples of such decoders are the ViterbiDecoder algorithm for convolutional codes or the PolarSCLDecoder for Polar codes (for a sufficiently large list size).\n\nIt is recommended to run the decoder in XLA mode as it significantly reduces the memory complexity.  \n  \n### Properties\n\n- **gm**: Generator matrix of the code.\n\n- **k**: Number of information bits per codeword.\n\n- **n**: Codeword length.\n\n- **t**: Order of the OSD algorithm.\n  "}]}

Thus, \nthe resulting systematic matrix (potentially) relates to a permuted version of\nthe code, this is defined by the returned list `column_swap`. \n\nIf a parity-check matrix is passed as input (i.e., `is_pcm` is True), the\nidentity part will be re-arranged to the last columns."}]}

Therefore, a set of traced paths could be reused for different values of these quantities, e.g., to calibrate the ray tracer.

This is particularly useful in distributed graph executions where you may have different sub-graph devices running the scrambler and descrambler. \n\nSetting this up involves two main steps: \n\n1. During initialization, you can pass an explicit seed to the Scrambler using the `seed` parameter. This creates a state for the Scrambler that remains fixed during runtime as these modules are implemented statelessly.\n   \n2. After defining the Scrambler, it's possible to change this seed for each call, should you require a new random seed for each call. You can do this by providing a tuple to the Scrambler or Descrambler when calling them. Specifically, provide a tuple of the form `(sequence, seed)`, where `sequence` is the binary or real-valued sequence for (de)scrambling and `seed` is the new seed you want to use.\n\nHere's an example in python:\n\n```python\n# Initialization with explicit seed\nscrambler = Scrambler(seed=1234, binary=True)\ndescrambler = Descrambler(scrambler=scrambler)\n\n# Advanced usage with explicit seed for each call\ns = tf.random.uniform((), minval=0, maxval=12345678, dtype=tf.int32)\nc_scr = scrambler([sequence, s])\nc_descr = descrambler([c_scr, s])\n```\n\nIn this code, `sequence` would be your binary or real-valued sequence. Note how a new seed `s` is generated for each call using TensorFlow's random uniform function, and then provided to the Scrambler and Descrambler in the tuple form mentioned above. This causes the scrambler to use the newly generated random seed for its operations, rather than the seed defined during initialization.\n\nRemember those steps apply to both Scrambler and TB5GScrambler, and Descrambler accepts the same input form allowing for dynamic (de)scrambling operations.\n\nLast but not least, always guarantee that 'binary' value is the same for the Scrambler and Descrambler to ensure consistent operations. If 'binary' is set to True, it indicates that binary operations are performed (bit-sequence flipping). If set to False, it indicates that soft-value/LLR domain-based operations are performed (sign flipping)."}]}

The `is_pcm` flag indicates whether the provided matrix is a parity-check matrix as opposed to a generator matrix, which changes the interpretation and handling of the matrix within the encoding process.\n\nThe constraints on the parity-check matrix when `is_pcm=True` are as follows:\n\n1. **Binary Matrix**: The parity-check matrix must be binary; that is, all of its elements must be either `0` or `1`. \n\n2. **Full Rank**: The parity-check matrix must be of full rank to ensure that it can be converted into a corresponding generator matrix. For a PCM of shape `[n-k, n]`, the rank must be `n-k`.\n\n3. **Shape**: Given that the PCM for a linear block code with parameters `[n, k]` has dimensions `[n-k, n]`, where `n` is the code length (the length of each codeword) and `k` is the number of information bits per codeword.\n\n4. **Conversion to Generator Matrix**: If `is_pcm=True`, the provided parity-check matrix is internally converted to a generator matrix using a function like `pcm2gm` for the encoding process. This internal conversion imposes the aforementioned constraints on the PCM.\n\n5. **Inherent Limitations**: It is important to note that the `LinearEncoder` is a generic encoder for binary linear block codes and is not optimized for any specific code structure. Hence, it might exhibit higher computational complexity compared to code-specific encoders.\n\nFor instance, considering a proper usage of `LinearEncoder` with `is_pcm=True`, you'd instantiate the encoder with a parity-check matrix following the above constraints:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.linear import LinearEncoder\n\n# Given a parity-check matrix `pcm` of shape [n-k, n] and full rank\nencoder = LinearEncoder(enc_mat=pcm, is_pcm=True)\n```\n\nWhile initializing an instance of `LinearEncoder`, verification procedures will typically check the validity of the supplied matrix to ensure it meets the criterion.

The most important of these is the `Scene` component, which includes methods for the computation of propagation 'Paths' (using `compute_paths()`) and 'CoverageMap' (using `coverage_map()`). Each `Scene` object represents a unique environment, complete with different structures and obstructions, where the radio waves propagate. You can preview a scene within a Jupyter notebook using `preview()` or render it to a file from the viewpoint of a camera using `render()` or `render_to_file()`.\n\nAfter computation of the paths, propagation `Paths` can be converted into time-varying channel impulse responses (CIRs) via `cir()`. The CIRs can then be used for link-level simulations in Sionna. The paper \"Sionna RT: Differentiable Ray Tracing for Radio Propagation Modeling\" demonstrates how this process can be used for various optimization tasks.\n\nNotably, a `Scene` can contain various scene objects, such as buildings and cars, each represented as an instance of the `SceneObject` class. Every scene object is defined by its geometry and material (`RadioMaterial`), the latter of which determines how radio waves interact with the object. This ability to include realistic 3D objects in the environment offers a significant advantage in accurately modeling radio propagation scenarios.\n\nIn terms of differentiation, `PlanarArray` allows you to create an array of identical antennas that are placed at different positions. The positions and orientation parameters can be assigned to a TensorFlow variable or tensor, which allows these parameters to be differentiated with respect to some learning parameters.\n\nThe 'Paths', 'CoverageMap', 'Camera', 'SceneObject', 'RadioMaterial', 'Transmitter', and 'Receiver', all play essential roles in accurately modeling and visualizing the radio wave propagation in a given scenario.

It can be initialized with either a generator matrix or a parity-check matrix. If a parity-check matrix is provided, the matrix is internally converted to a corresponding generator matrix for encoding purposes.\n\nThe computational complexity of the `LinearEncoder` is `O(k^2)`, where `k` is the number of information bits per codeword. This quadratic complexity arises due to the nature of matrix operations involved in linear encoding; specifically, the necessary matrix multiplication between the k-dimensional input vector and the `k x n` generator matrix to produce the n-dimensional codeword.\n\nThe implication of this computational complexity is that while the encoding process for linear block codes is relatively efficient for small values of `k`, it might become impractically time-consuming for very large values. In cases where high-speed or real-time encoding is necessary, especially for codes with large `k`, optimized encoders that leverage specific properties of certain code families are recommended. The Sionna package itself suggests using more specialized encoders like `Polar5GEncoder` or `LDPC5GEncoder` for potential optimizations and better performance, as they are tailored to the structure of Polar and LDPC codes, respectively.\n\nHere's how you would typically set up and use the `LinearEncoder` with the Sionna package:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.linear import LinearEncoder\n\n# Assume 'pcm' is a parity-check matrix (or a generator matrix if is_pcm=False)\n# Also assume that 'k' and 'n' are the number of information bits and codeword length, respectively\nencoder = LinearEncoder(enc_mat=pcm, is_pcm=True)\n```\n\nIn the above code snippet, `enc_mat` represents the encoding matrix which can either be the generator matrix or parity-check matrix (when `is_pcm` is True), and the `LinearEncoder` initializes with this matrix. It's important to note that, for the parity-check matrix to be converted into a generator matrix successfully, it must be of full rank and binary.\n\nGiven the `O(k^2)` computational complexity, for large-scale applications or instances where computational resources are limited, it would be beneficial to consider the nature of the specific encoding task at hand and potentially prioritize the use of more specialized and optimized encoding mechanisms that can handle large k efficiently, if those are applicable."}]}

The higher the number of samples is, the more accurate the MSE estimation is, at the cost of longer compute time.\n\nFinally, plot the MSE for each method against the SNR to compare their performance."}]}

Here is an example of how to do this:\n\n```python\npusch_config_ext = pusch_config.clone()\npusch_config_ext.carrier.cyclic_prefix = \"extended\"\npusch_config_ext.carrier.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, `pusch_config` is an instance of `PUSCHConfig`. The `clone()` method is used to create a copy of this instance, and then the `cyclic_prefix` attribute of the associated `CarrierConfig` instance is set to \"extended\".\n\nChanging to the extended cyclic prefix affects the number of OFDM symbols per slot. Specifically, the number of OFDM symbols per slot decreases from 14 to 12. This is because the extended cyclic prefix provides a longer guard interval, which reduces the number of OFDM symbols that can be fit into a slot. This can be beneficial in scenarios where there is a high level of multipath propagation, as the extended cyclic prefix can help to mitigate inter-symbol interference."}]}

These functions affect the way messages are passed and updated between check nodes (CNs) and variable nodes (VNs) in the iterative decoding process. The three functions are:\n\n1. **boxplus (`\"boxplus\"`):** This function implements the standard belief propagation algorithm for updating check nodes. The formula for updating the message from check node j to variable node i is given by:\n\n   $$\n   y_{j \\rightarrow i} = 2 \\operatorname{tanh}^{-1} \\left( \\prod_{i' \\in \\mathcal{N}(j) \\setminus i} \\operatorname{tanh} \\left( \\frac{x_{i' \\rightarrow j}}{2} \\right) \\right)\n   $$\n\n   - $\\mathcal{N}(j)$ denotes all indices of connected VNs to CN j.\n   - $x_{i' \\rightarrow j}$ is the message from VN i' to CN j.\n   - $y_{j \\rightarrow i}$ is the outgoing message from CN j to VN i.\n   \n   The implication of using this method is that it's computationally intensive due to the hyperbolic tangent functions but achieves more accurate decoding results. It is suitable for scenarios where decoding performance is prioritized over computational efficiency.\n\n2. **boxplus-phi (`\"boxplus-phi\"`):** This is a numerically stable version of the boxplus operation and uses a function $\\phi$ to improve stability. The update formula is:\n\n   $$\n   y_{j \\rightarrow i} = \\alpha_{j \\rightarrow i} \\cdot \\phi \\left( \\sum_{i' \\in \\mathcal{N}(j) \\setminus i} \\phi \\left( |x_{i' \\rightarrow j}| \\right) \\right)\n   $$\n\n   - $\\phi(x) = -\\log(\\tanh \\left(\\frac{x}{2}) \\right)$\n   - $\\alpha_{j \\rightarrow i} = \\prod_{i' \\in \\mathcal{N}(j) \\setminus i} \\operatorname{sign}(x_{i' \\rightarrow j})$ is the product of the signs of the incoming messages, determining the sign of the outgoing message.\n   \n   The key implication of this approach is that it avoids the direct computation of the inverse hyperbolic tangent function, which can be problematic for very small or very large values. It's computationally more efficient than the boxplus method, yet still provides good decoding performance.\n\n3. **min-sum (`\"minsum\"`):** This method uses a min-sum approximation to simplify the check node update formula, trading off some decoding accuracy for a reduction in computational complexity. The update function is:\n\n   $$\n   y_{j \\rightarrow i} = \\alpha_{j \\rightarrow i} \\cdot \\min_{i' \\in \\mathcal{N}(j) \\setminus i} \\left(|x_{i' \\rightarrow j}|\\right)\n   $$\n\n   - As before, $\\alpha_{j \\rightarrow i}$ is the product of the signs of the incoming messages.\n\n   The min-sum algorithm is a simplification of the boxplus function that replaces the summation of log-domain values with the minimum operation, significantly reducing computation. The min-sum function is the most computationally efficient among the three and is used in scenarios where high speed is crucial and some loss of decoding performance is tolerable.\n\nEach of these functions is selectable based on the desired trade-off between performance and computational complexity in the application at hand. The `LDPCBPDecoder` can be used with any of the methods by setting the `cn_type` argument to the desired update function (`\"boxplus\"`, `\"boxplus-phi\"`, or `\"minsum\"`). \n\nIt is important to note that while the `LDPCBPDecoder` can be instantiated and its check node update function specified, the context does not provide detailed Python code demonstrating how to set these parameters during instantiation. For accurate code usage, the Sionna documentation or API reference should be consulted."}]}

The principle idea is to treat each component decoder (or demapper etc.) as an individual entity with its own EXIT characteristic.

The BICM system includes components such as a mapper/demapper, an LDPC encoder/decoder, an AWGN channel, and a binary source. \n\nThe EXIT charts are generated by tracking the average extrinsic mutual information after each iteration at the output of the variable node (VN) and check node (CN) decoder. This is done by initializing the LDPCBPDecoder with the option `track_exit`=True. The analytical EXIT characteristics for a given code can be obtained using the `get_exit_analytic` function. The actual exit trajectory during decoding can be accessed by `decoder.ie_v/decoder.ie_c` after the simulation.\n\nThe convergence behavior can be visualized by plotting the EXIT curves and the simulated trajectory. This allows for a comparison between the predicted EXIT functions of the VN and CN decoder and the actual decoding trajectory. \n\nIn the context provided, the EXIT charts are also used to analyze the impact of mismatched demapping and the advantages of min-sum decoding.

Its purpose is to take a resource grid as input and to output an identical resource grid, but without any nulled subcarriers.

This is the resource grid from which the nulled subcarriers should be removed.\n\nThe typical process the `RemoveNulledSubcarriers` performs includes the following steps:\n\n- The class receives a full resource grid as input. This grid is a tensor with dimensions `[batch_size, num_tx, num_streams_per_tx, num_ofdm_symbols, fft_size]` and its type is `tf.complex64`. The grid contains subcarriers that are nulled.\n- The `RemoveNulledSubcarriers` function processes the input to remove any nulled subcarrier.\n- The function returns a resource grid, which is also a tensor but with dimensions `[batch_size, num_tx, num_streams_per_tx, num_ofdm_symbols, num_effective_subcarriers]`. Again, its type is `tf.complex64`. This returned grid is same as the input but with nulled subcarriers removed.\n\nThe `RemoveNulledSubcarriers` class is an important part of the data preprocessing stage in an OFDM system. Before any data can be mapped onto the OFDM symbols for modulation, any guard and DC carriers that are nulled need to be removed, especially in a simulation or modeling scenario.

These channels are used for transmitting binary inputs by using the Sionna API.\n\n1. **BinaryMemorylessChannel**: This channel is designed to transmit binary inputs where bits are flipped with different probabilities for input bit values of 0 and 1, referred to as $p_{b,0}$ and $p_{b,1}$ respectively. The Layer can also return log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) instead of binary values if desired, as indicated by the parameter 'return_llrs.'\n\n2. **BinarySymmetricChannel**: This channel randomly flips bits with a certain probability, denoted by $p_{b}$. The channel supports both binary and bipolar inputs, and can return LLRs instead of binary values if the 'return_llrs' parameter is set to True.\n\n3. **BinaryErasureChannel**: This channel is used for erasure transmission, i.e., a bit is either correctly received or erased. The 'pb' parameter determines the erasure probability which can be a scalar or a tensor. When 'return_llrs' is set to True, the channel returns log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) instead of binary values based on `pb`.\n\n4. **BinaryZChannel**: In this channel, transmission errors only occur for the transmission of the second input element with error probability $p_{b}$ but the first element is always correctly received. This channel can also return log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) instead of binary values if the 'return_llrs' parameter is set to true.\n\nAll these channels inherit from the Keras `Layer`, and hence, can be used as a layer in a Keras model. Each of these channel layers supports both binary and bipolar input types. When the 'bipolar_input' parameter is set to True, the expected input is given as {-1,1} instead of {0,1}. Each of these channels allows for different error or bit flipping probabilities per bit position. The datatype for internal calculations and the output is determined by the 'dtype' parameter which defaults to 'tf.float32'."}]}

Then, use this filter to pulse shape a sequence of QAM symbols. This requires upsampling of the sequence to the desired sampling rate. The sampling rate is defined as the number of samples per symbol, and upsampling simply means that zeros are inserted after every QAM symbol. After upsampling, apply the filter.\n\n2. **Recovering the QAM symbols through matched filtering and downsampling**: To recover the QAM symbols from this waveform, apply a matched filter, i.e., the same filter in our case, and downsample the result, starting from the correct index. This index can be obtained as follows. The transmit filter has its peak value after (L-1)/2 samples, where L is the filter length. If we apply the same filter for reception, the peak will be delayed by a total of L-1 samples. \n\n3. **Visualizing the different signals**: You can visualize the different signals by plotting the real parts of the oversampled sequence of QAM symbols, the transmitted sequence after pulse shaping, and the received sequence after matched filtering. \n\n4. **Scatter plot of the transmitted and recovered symbols**: As further verification, show a scatter plot of the transmitted and recovered symbols and compute the mean-squared error (MSE) between them. \n\n5. **Investigating the ACLR**: An important metric of waveforms is the so-called adjacent channel leakage power ratio, or short ACLR. It is defined as the ratio of the out-of-band power and the in-band power. One can get a first idea of the ACLR by looking at the power spectral density (PSD) of a transmitted signal. The resulting ACLR can be computed with the following convenience function.\n\n6. **Windowing**: Windowing can be used to improve the spectral properties of a truncated filter. For a filter of length L, a window is a real-valued vector of the same length that is multiplied element-wise with the filter coefficients. This is equivalent to a convolution of the filter and the window in the frequency domain. \n\nRemember to use the appropriate Sionna APIs for each step. For example, use the `Upsampling` and `Downsampling` layers for upsampling and downsampling, and the `RootRaisedCosineFilter` for creating the root-raised-cosine filter. Use the `empirical_psd` and `empirical_aclr` functions to compute the empirical power spectral density (PSD) and adjacent channel leakage power ratio (ACLR)."}]}

Create a generator that can parse the dataset. In the given context, an HDF5 file storing path coefficients and delays is used. The generator is created using a class that implements the `__call__()` method. This method opens the HDF5 file and yields the path coefficients and delays for each item in the dataset.\n\n```python\nclass HD5CIRGen:\n    def __init__(self, filename):\n        self.filename = filename\n    def __call__(self):\n        with h5py.File(self.filename, 'r') as hf:\n            for im in zip(hf[\"a\"], hf[\"tau\"]):\n                a = im[0]\n                tau = im[1]\n                yield im\n```\n\n2. Use the generator to create a channel model. The channel model is created using the `sn.channel.CIRDataset` function, which takes the generator and other parameters like batch size, number of receivers, number of receiver antennas, number of transmitters, number of transmitter antennas, number of paths, and number of time steps.\n\n```python\nbatch_size = 64\nchannel_model = sn.channel.CIRDataset(generator,\n                                      batch_size,\n                                      num_rx,\n                                      num_rx_ant,\n                                      num_tx,\n                                      num_tx_ant,\n                                      num_paths,\n                                      num_time_steps)\n```\n\n3. Sample from the dataset using the channel model. The channel model can be called like a function to sample from the dataset. The `__call__` function of the channel model returns the path coefficients and delays.\n\n```python\na, tau = channel_model()\n```\n\nThis way, you can sample from the dataset in the same way as you would from a stochastic channel model."}]}

Shot noise is neglected here but is required to derive the noise power of the amplifier, as otherwise the input SNR is infinitely large. Hence, for the input SNR, it follows [G. P. Agrawal, \u201cFiber-optic Communication Systems\u201d, 4th ed. Wiley series in microwave and optical engineering 222. New York: Wiley, 2010.] that $\\mathrm{SNR}_\\mathrm{in}=\\frac{P}{2hf_cW}$, where $h$ denotes Planck\u2019s constant, $P$ is the signal power, and $W$ the considered bandwidth. The output SNR is decreased by ASE noise induced by the amplification. Note that shot noise is applied after the amplifier and is hence not amplified. It results that $\\mathrm{SNR}_\\mathrm{out}=\\frac{GP}{\\left(4\\rho_\\mathrm{ASE}+2hf_c\\right)W}$, where $G$ is the parametrized gain. Hence, one can write the former equation as $F_\\mathrm{ASE,shot} = 2n_\\mathrm{sp} \\left(1-G^{-1}\\right) + G^{-1}$. Dropping shot noise again results in $F = 2n_\\mathrm{sp} \\left(1-G^{-1}\\right)=2 n_\\mathrm{sp} \\frac{G-1}{G}$.\n\nFor a transparent link, e.g., the required gain per span is $G = \\exp\\left(\\alpha \\ell \\right)$. The spontaneous emission factor is $n_\\mathrm{sp}=\\frac{F} {2}\\frac{G}{G-1}$. According to [G. P. Agrawal, \u201cFiber-optic Communication Systems\u201d, 4th ed. Wiley series in microwave and optical engineering 222. New York: Wiley, 2010.] and [R. J. Essiambre, G. Kramer, P. J. Winzer, G. J. Foschini, and B.

Desurvire, \u201cModeling Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers\u201d, Journal of Lightwave Technology 9, No. 2, 1991.], the noise power spectral density of the EDFA per state of polarization is obtained as $\\rho_\\mathrm{ASE}^{(1)} = n_\\mathrm{sp}\\left(G-1\\right) h f_c=\\frac{1}{2}G F h f_c$. At simulation frequency $f_\\mathrm{sim}$, the noise has a power of $P_\\mathrm{ASE}^{(1)}=\\sigma_\\mathrm{n,ASE}^2=2\\rho_\\mathrm{ASE}^{(1)} \\cdot f_\\mathrm{sim}$, where the factor $2$ accounts for the unpolarized noise (for dual polarization the factor is $1$ per polarization). Here, the notation $()^{(1)}$ means that this is the noise introduced by a single EDFA.\n\nThis class inherits from the Keras Layer class and can be used as layer in a Keras model.\n\n**Example**\nSetting-up:\n\n```python\nedfa = EDFA(\n    g=4.0,\n    f=2.0,\n    f_c=193.55e12,\n    dt=1.0e-12,\n    with_dual_polarization=False)\n```\n\nRunning:\n```python\n# x is the optical input signal\ny = EDFA(x)\n```\n\n**Parameters**\n\n- `g` (float): Amplifier gain (linear domain).

Part of the energy gets reflected while the other part gets refracted, or propagates into the surface. There are two types of reflection: specular and diffuse. Diffuse reflection is also known as diffuse scattering. When a ray hits a diffuse reflection surface, it is not reflected into a single (specular) direction but rather scattered toward many different directions. \n\nScattering is important in the context of ray tracing experiments because it significantly influences the propagation of electromagnetic waves. In ray tracing, an incoming ray essentially spawns infinitely many scattered rays, while there is only a single specular path. This means that to compute the scattered field at a particular position, one needs to integrate the scattered field over the entire surface. \n\nScattering also plays a crucial role in creating coverage maps in complex scenes with many scattering surfaces. Coverage maps describe the average received power from a specific transmitter at every point on a plane, and scattering can help ensure that most regions in the scene have some coverage. \n\nMoreover, scattering can have a significant impact on the link-level performance of a communication system, as it can cause differences in the channel impulse responses, which describe the response of the channel to an impulse input signal. \n\nIn summary, understanding and accurately modeling scattering is essential for predicting and analyzing the behavior of electromagnetic waves in various environments, which is crucial in the design and optimization of wireless communication systems."}]}

For example, if you are using a 5G LDPC code, you can initialize the encoder and decoder as follows:\n\n```python\nenc = LDPC5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\ndec = LDPC5GDecoder(enc, num_iter=20)\n```\n\n4. Initialize the system model with the encoder and decoder.\n\n```python\nmodel = System_Model(k=k,\n                     n=n,\n                     num_bits_per_symbol=num_bits_per_symbol,\n                     encoder=enc,\n                     decoder=dec)\n```\n\n5. Run the BER simulation for the system model. This can be done using the `simulate` method of the `PlotBER` class. The `simulate` method takes as input the system model, the SNR range, and various other parameters related to the simulation.\n\n```python\nber_plot.simulate(model, \n                  ebno_dbs=ebno_db, \n                  legend=code[2], \n                  max_mc_iter=100, \n                  num_target_block_errors=1000, \n                  batch_size=10000, \n                  soft_estimates=False, \n                  early_stop=True, \n                  show_fig=False, \n                  add_bler=True, \n                  forward_keyboard_interrupt=True)\n```\n\n6. Finally, plot the BER performance using the `PlotBER` instance.\n\nPlease note that the exact code may vary depending on the specific coding scheme and system model you are using. The above code is just a general guideline and may need to be adjusted to fit your specific use case."}]}

It provides a range of features and follows certain design principles to ensure efficient data flow and ease of use.\n\nKey Features:\n1. **Batching**: Sionna inherently parallelizes simulations via batching, where each element in the batch dimension is simulated independently.\n2. **Keras Layer Implementation**: Signal-processing components are implemented as individual Keras layers.\n3. **Datatype Preference**: `tf.float32` is used as the preferred datatype and `tf.complex64` for complex-valued datatypes.\n4. **Eager and Graph Modes**: Models can be developed in eager mode for simple and fast modification of system parameters. For number crunching simulations, the faster graph mode or XLA acceleration is available.\n5. **Automatic Differentiability**: Components are automatically differentiable via auto-grad to simplify the deep learning design-flow.\n6. **Structured Code**: The code is structured into sub-packages for different tasks such as channel coding, mapping, etc.\n\nBasic Principles:\n1. **Inter-frame Parallelization**: The first tensor dimension is always used for inter-frame parallelization, similar to an outer for-loop in Matlab/NumPy simulations.\n2. **Reusability and Reliability**: The division into individual blocks simplifies deployment and all layers and functions come with unit tests to ensure their correct behavior.\n3. **GPU Compatibility**: Sionna does not require a GPU but can run on it. It also provides the ability to restrict the notebook to single-GPU usage and set memory growth as active to avoid instantiating the whole GPU memory when initialized.\n\nThe Sionna package also supports multi-dimensional tensors, has built-in plotting functions for easy visualization of results, and can be used for exhaustive training and Monte-Carlo simulations."}]}

These pilot patterns are used for channel estimation in multi-antenna systems.

Each transmitted layer is identified by a DMRS port, i.e., a distinct pilot pattern. \n\nTo configure DMRS ports for different transmitters, you can clone the original PUSCHConfig and change the DMRS port set. For example, if you have three transmitters and you want each one to use a different DMRS port, you can do the following:\n\n```python\n# Clone the original PUSCHConfig and change the DMRS port set\npusch_config_1 = pusch_config.clone()\npusch_config_1.dmrs.dmrs_port_set = [1]\npusch_config_2 = pusch_config.clone()\npusch_config_2.dmrs.dmrs_port_set = [2]\npusch_config_3 = pusch_config.clone()\npusch_config_3.dmrs.dmrs_port_set = [3]\n# Create a PUSCHTransmitter from the list of PUSCHConfigs\npusch_transmitter_multi = PUSCHTransmitter([pusch_config, pusch_config_1, pusch_config_2, pusch_config_3])\n```\n\nIn this example, the first transmitter uses DMRS port 0, the second transmitter uses DMRS port 1, and the third transmitter uses DMRS port 2. \n\nRemember that the number of DMRS ports is independent of the number of antenna ports. Each layer is simply mapped to one of the antenna ports if no precoding is used. If precoding is used, each layer is mapped to a distinct DMRS port."}]}

This leads to an increase in the dynamic range by around 16dB due to the reduced diffracted field in deep shadow areas, such as behind buildings. \n\nIn other words, the higher the frequency, the less significant the diffracted field becomes, leading to a larger dynamic range in the coverage map."}]}

Specifically, it implements a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) equalization algorithm within an OFDM waveform.\n\nWorking with the OFDM waveform, the `OFDMEqualizer` class preprocesses the received resource grid `y` and channel estimate `h_hat`, and it calculates the noise-plus-interference covariance matrix for each receiver according to the OFDM and stream configuration provided by the `resource_grid` and `stream_management`. This process also takes into account the channel estimation error variance `err_var`. \n\nThe `OFDMEqualizer` must be initialized with a callable object, such as a function, that implements a MIMO equalization algorithm. This callable object or function takes as input the received signals `y`, the channel matrices `h`, and the noise-plus-interference covariance matrices. The callable object should return two outputs: the estimated symbol vectors `x_hat` and the effective noise variance estimates.\n\nKey output of this equalization process includes estimated symbols in terms of soft-symbol estimates and effective noise variances for all streams. These outputs could be used in further processing stages such as the demapping process to obtain log-likelihood ratios (LLRs).\n\nThis equalization process is paramount when dealing with multi-path propagation, time-varying channels, and interference, thus improving system performance. It helps in applying inverse transmission channel properties to the received signal, reducing interference, and improving signal quality.\n\nNote that the workings of the `OFDMEqualizer` class depend on classes such as `ResourceGrid`, `StreamManagement`, and a callable equalizer object that provide the necessary information about the OFDM and stream configuration, and the MIMO equalization algorithm, respectively."}]}

Under these conditions, the performance of any codeword is theoretically identical due to the symmetry of the channel and the linearity of the code. Therefore, simulating the all-zero codeword gives an accurate representation of the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance for the entire codebook.\n\nHowever, this is not the case for channels that lack symmetry or when using higher-order modulation schemes. Under such conditions, the all-zero codeword trick can yield inaccurate performance estimations. Scrambling is required in these situations to ensure that the bits being transmitted have no pattern that could lead to a biased representation of the code's performance on the channel. Scrambling effectively randomizes the pattern of the transmitted bits, thus ensuring the channel's symmetry assumption is met, and an accurate estimation of the code's performance can be inferred from the simulation of the all-zero codeword.\n\nThe context provides information about a package that supports binary linear block codes with generic encoding and decoding capabilities, as well as code-specific implementations. To reference the relevant parts of the provided context about the all-zero codeword simulation and why scrambling could be necessary, consider the following from the `AllZeroEncoder` class documentation:\n\n> As the all-zero codeword is part of any linear code, it is often used to simulate BER curves of arbitrary (LDPC) codes without the need of having access to the actual generator matrix. However, this all-zero codeword trick requires symmetric channels (such as BPSK), otherwise scrambling is required (cf. [[Pfister]](fec.ldpc.html#pfister) for further details).\n\nWhen simulating the all-zero codeword using the Sionna package, you might set up an `AllZeroEncoder` and an `OSDecoder` without requiring a generator matrix:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.linear import AllZeroEncoder, OSDecoder\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Parameters for the AllZeroEncoder\nk, n = 100, 200 # choose your own k and n\n# Instantiate the AllZeroEncoder\nall_zero_encoder = AllZeroEncoder(k, n)\n# Define your own enc_mat\nenc_mat = np.array([[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n                [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n                [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]])\n# Using the resulting all-zero encoder for the codeword\n# Assuming enc_mat is a parity-check or generator matrix\n# and t is the order for the OSD algorithm, choose your own t\ndecoder = OSDecoder(enc_mat=enc_mat, t=4, is_pcm=True)  # if using parity-check matrix\n# or initialize with the encoder if you have one\n# decoder = OSDecoder(encoder=all_zero_encoder, t=t)  # assuming you have a specific encoder\n\n```\n\nThis code sets up an `AllZeroEncoder`, which always outputs the all-zero codeword, and an `OSDecoder`, which implements the OSD decoding algorithm.\n\nIn practice, you'd need to ensure the conditions for the valid use of the all-zero codeword simulation are met and apply scrambling if required, based on the channel characteristics and modulation scheme in use."}]}

This layer computes soft-symbol estimates together with effective noise variances for all streams which can, e.g., be used by a Demapper to obtain LLRs.\n\n**Note:** \nThe callable equalizer must take three inputs:\n\n- y ([\u2026,num_rx_ant], tf.complex) \u2013 1+D tensor containing the received signals. \n- h ([\u2026,num_rx_ant,num_streams_per_rx], tf.complex) \u2013 2+D tensor containing the channel matrices.\n- s ([\u2026,num_rx_ant,num_rx_ant], tf.complex) \u2013 2+D tensor containing the noise-plus-interference covariance matrices.\n\nIt must generate two outputs:\n- x_hat ([\u2026,num_streams_per_rx], tf.complex) \u2013 1+D tensor representing the estimated symbol vectors.\n- no_eff (tf.float) \u2013 Tensor of the same shape as x_hat containing the effective noise variance estimates.\n\n**Parameters**\n\n- `equalizer` (Callable): Callable object (e.g., a function) that implements a MIMO equalization algorithm for arbitrary batch dimensions.\n- `resource_grid` (ResourceGrid): Instance of ResourceGrid.\n- `stream_management` (StreamManagement): Instance of StreamManagement.\n- `dtype` (tf.Dtype): Datatype for internal calculations and the output dtype. Defaults to tf.complex64.\n\n**Input**\n\n- `(y, h_hat, err_var, no)` \u2013 Tuple:\n  - `y` ([batch_size, num_rx, num_rx_ant, num_ofdm_symbols, fft_size], tf.complex): Received OFDM resource grid after cyclic prefix removal and FFT.\n  - `h_hat` ([batch_size, num_rx, num_rx_ant, num_tx, num_streams_per_tx, num_ofdm_symbols, num_effective_subcarriers], tf.complex): Channel estimates for all streams from all transmitters.\n  - `err_var` ([Broadcastable to shape of h_hat], tf.float): Variance of the channel estimation error.\n  - `no` ([batch_size, num_rx, num_rx_ant] or only the first n dimensions, tf.float): Variance of the AWGN.\n\n**Output**\n\n- `x_hat` ([batch_size, num_tx, num_streams, num_data_symbols], tf.complex): Estimated symbols.\n- `no_eff` ([batch_size, num_tx, num_streams, num_data_symbols], tf.float): Effective noise variance for each estimated symbol."}]}

The possible values for this parameter can be 'CRC24A', 'CRC24B', 'CRC24C', 'CRC16', 'CRC11', 'CRC6'. \n\n2. 'dtype' is of type 'tf.DType'.By default, it is 'tf.float32'. It is used to define the output data type. \n\nThere may also be additional keyword arguments (kwargs*) which can be handled in the function, yet there's no specific description provided about any additional arguments in the given context. \n\nIt's also important to note that AssertionError will be raised if the 'crc_degree' is not of type 'str' and ValueError will be thrown if the requested CRC polynomial is not valid. Moreover, the function adds cyclic redundancy check to the input sequence and if `input` doesn't have at least rank 2, then InvalidArgumentError will be thrown. \n\nAlso, the class inherits from the Keras layer class and can be used as layer in a Keras model.

You can optionally specify whether it should return log-likelihood ratios and if the input is binary or bipolar. \n\nThe Binary Symmetric Channel expects a tuple as input which consists of an input sequence to the channel (x) and the bit flipping probability (pb).\n\n```python\nbsc = BinarySymmetricChannel(return_llrs=False, bipolar_input=False)\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `BinarySymmetricChannel` is initiated to expect binary inputs and return binary outputs. If you want to change this behavior, you can set `return_llrs` to True for the channel to return log-likelihood ratios, and set `bipolar_input` to True for the channel to expect bipolar inputs.\n\nFinally, to run the channel with your own inputs, you provide your input sequence x and the bit flipping probability pb. \n\nIn the example below, a tensor of zeros with dimension 128 is used as input sequence (x). The bit flipping probability (pb) is set to 0.1.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nx = tf.zeros((128,)) # x is the channel input\npb = 0.1 # pb is the bit flipping probability\ny = bsc((x, pb))\n```\n\nThe variable `y` now contains the output sequence from the channel."}]}

As described in the context, the LinearEncoder can be initialized with these matrices and can take an option to indicate whether the provided matrix is a parity-check matrix.\n\nHere's how you can instantiate a `LinearEncoder` and use it to encode information bits:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.linear import LinearEncoder\n\n# Assuming you have a binary generator matrix 'G' of shape [k, n]\n# where 'k' is the number of information bits\n# and 'n' is the codeword length (number of bits in the codeword)\n# If you have a parity-check matrix 'H', set is_pcm=True and enc_mat=H\nencoder = LinearEncoder(enc_mat=G, is_pcm=False)\n```\n\nTo encode information bits using `LinearEncoder`, make sure that your information bits are in the shape of [..., k], where 'k' is the number of information bits per codeword. The '...' represents any number of dimensions, which allows for batch processing of many codewords at once.\n\nHere's an example using placeholders to represent the information bits:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Placeholder for information bits with shape [..., k]\n# For the sake of an example, let's assume k=4 for a (7,4) code\nk = 4\nu = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, k])\n\n# Encode the information bits to obtain the codewords\nc = encoder(u)\n```\n\nAfter running the encoding operation, the output `c` will have the shape [..., n], keeping the same batch dimensions as the input `u`, with the last dimension being 'n', the codeword length.\n\nNote that the details of the generator or parity-check matrix initialization have been abstracted here, as the actual matrices are not provided in the context. Please acquire a valid binary generator or parity-check matrix of full rank to use in this process.\n\nLastly, verify that the `LinearEncoder` you instantiate actually matches the `from sionna.fec.linear import LinearEncoder` directive as provided, without interchange or alteration."}]}

These window functions are primarily used in filtering operations to reduce signal leakage and spectral distortion.\n\nThe Window class itself is an abstract base class and is not used directly. However, it provides essential structure for subsequent concrete classes like HannWindow, HammingWindow, BlackmanWindow, and CustomWindow. Each of these classes represents its named windowing function, and are used to create respective window instances.\n\nThe Window class takes four primary parameters:\n1. `length` (int): The window length in number of samples.\n2. `trainable` (bool): Defines if window coefficients are trainable variables, default value is `False`.\n3. `normalize` (bool): If set to `True`, the window is normalized to have unit average power per coefficient, default value is `False`.\n4. `dtype` (tf.DType): The dtype of the filter coefficients, default value is `tf.float32`.\n\nThe main method of the Window class is `show(samples_per_symbol, domain='time', scale='lin')`. This method plots the window in the time or frequency domain, depending on user preference. \n\nTo utilize these window classes, an instance of the desired windowing function (i.e., `HannWindow`, `HammingWindow`, etc.) is created with the relevant parameters, then applied to the desired input data through methods defined on the window instance. This can be particularly effective in filtering operations such as in the use of the `SincFilter`, `RaisedCosineFilter`, `RootRaisedCosineFilter`, or `CustomFilter` where the `window` parameter might take an instance of one of these windowing functions to customize the filter's response. \n\nUsing these windowing functions allow for the reduction of sidelobe levels and frequency leakage, which can result in improved filter performance and better signal integrity. These windowing functions provide a crucial part of accurate signal processing and are fundamental in providing clean, accurate signal transmission and recovery."}]}

After a signal has been transmitted over a communication channel, it is affected by noise and other impairments, which means the receiver must employ algorithms to estimate the original transmitted bits.\n\nA \"demapper\" is a functional component of a receiver used in digital communications that processes the received signal and translates it into LLRs. This step takes place after demodulation, where the modulated waveform is translated back into a digital signal. The demapper evaluates the likelihood of each bit being a '0' or a '1' based on the received waveform and specific characteristics of the noise present in the channel.\n\nThe instruction 'LLRs must be calculated with a demapper' post-transmission refers to the process of using a demapping algorithm to convert the received analog signal into LLRs for subsequent use in a decoding algorithm. This is typically required when employing advanced decoding techniques like the Ordered Statistics Decoding (OSD) method implemented by `OSDecoder` in the Sionna package.\n\nThe `OSDecoder` requires LLRs as input for its decoding process. In the example provided in the context, the LLRs (`llr_ch`) are calculated after the signal transmission and before feeding them into the decoder as follows:\n\n```python\nc_hat = decoder(llr_ch)\n```\n\nThe LLRs are provided to the `OSDecoder` instance, which performs the OSD algorithm to attempt to recover the original sequence of information bits from the noisy received codeword represented by the LLRs. This involves statistical operations based on the log-likelihoods of received bits, along with error correction techniques specific to the type of code used (e.g., binary linear block codes in the context given).\n\nWhile the code examples given focus on initializing and using encoders such as `LinearEncoder` and decoders like `OSDecoder`, the actual LLR calculation with a demapper is not explicitly shown, but is assumed to occur as part of the receiver's signal processing chain in practical implementations. This demapping process could be specific to the modulation scheme used (e.g., BPSK, QAM) and must be done in accordance with the noise characteristics of the channel and the receiver architecture."}]}

The `TurboEncoder` class requires certain parameters to be defined, such as generator polynomials (`gen_poly`), constraint length, rate, termination, and so on, which can be inferred from the context.\n\nAn expected input to the `TurboEncoder` would be a 2+D tensor of information bits with shape `[..., k]`, where `k` is the number of information bits. The output from the encoder would be a 2+D tensor of encoded codeword bits with shape `[..., k/rate]`. However, if the `terminate` parameter is `True`, the true rate of the Turbo code will be slightly less than `rate`.\n\nLet's go through a practical example of using `TurboEncoder` with a rate of 1/3, showing the import statements and the necessary set-up.\n\nFirst, we'll need to import the `TurboEncoder` class:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.turbo import TurboEncoder\n```\n\nWe will initiate an instance of the `TurboEncoder` with the rate set to 1/3 and assuming we want to terminate the encoder:\n\n```python\n# For demonstration, let's assume the constraint length is 4\nconstraint_length = 4\n\n# Create the TurboEncoder instance with termination. Note that this results\n# in a rate loss. In practice, the gen_poly may need to be specified or\n# obtained from a polynomial selector for rsc codes based on the constraint \n# length, which could be fetched with dataframe operations like `polynomial_selector`.\nencoder = TurboEncoder(constraint_length=constraint_length,\n                       rate=1/3,\n                       terminate=True)\n```\n\nNow, let's assume you have a batch of information bits you wish to encode. The information bits should be supplied as a 2+D tensor of `tf.float32` with the last dimension size `k`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Example: A batch of 10 sequences of 100 information bits each.\n# In practice, k needs to be an int.\nk = 100\nu = tf.random.uniform((10, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\nu = tf.cast(u, dtype=tf.float32)  # Cast to float32 for the encoder\n```\n\nWe will now pass this tensor of information bits `u` to the `encoder` to get the encoded codewords:\n\n```python\n# Perform the encoding operation\nc = encoder(u)\n```\n\nAfter this operation, `c` will contain the turbo encoded codewords. The shape of `c` will depend on the termination and the rate. If `terminate` is `True`, the effective rate will be slightly lower than the design rate due to the inclusion of termination bits. For rate 1/3 and `terminate=True`, the true rate is `k / (k/rate + 4*(constraint_length - 1)/(3*rate))`. Given `k` information bits, you can expect the output shape to be `[..., n]` where `n` is the length of the codeword as a result of encoding.\n\nNote: The exact shapes must be calculated based on the provided context, considering any rate loss due to termination.\n\nThis demonstration has been crafted according to the contained details. The code and descriptions should still be verified against the Sionna documentation to ensure accuracy in a real-world application, especially because the generator polynomial was not provided here and would need to be selected appropriately for the desired constraint length."}]}

First, you need to generate a signal. In the context, a sequence of QAM symbols is generated and then upsampled. The upsampled sequence is then passed through a root-raised-cosine filter for pulse shaping. The output of this filter is the transmitted signal.\n\n2. Once you have the transmitted signal, you can compute its Power Spectral Density (PSD). In the context, the `empirical_psd` function from the `sionna.signal` module is used for this purpose. The function takes the transmitted signal and the oversampling factor as inputs. The oversampling factor is the number of samples per symbol used in the upsampling process. The function will return the PSD of the signal.\n\n3. After computing the PSD, you can visualize it to get a first idea of the ACLR. The in-band is defined by the interval from [-0.5, 0.5] in normalized frequency. Any energy located outside of this band is considered out-of-band.\n\n4. To compute the ACLR, you can use the `empirical_aclr` function from the `sionna.signal` module. This function takes the transmitted signal and the oversampling factor as inputs and returns the ACLR. The ACLR is defined as the ratio of the out-of-band power to the in-band power.\n\n5. Finally, you can compare the empirical ACLR with the theoretical ACLR that can be computed based on the magnitude response of the pulse-shaping filter. In the context, this is done by accessing the `aclr` property of the filter object.\n\nHere is the relevant code from the context:\n\n```python\n# Compute the PSD\nempirical_psd(x_rrcf, oversampling=samples_per_symbol, ylim=[-100, 3]);\n\n# Compute the ACLR\naclr_db = 10*np.log10(empirical_aclr(x_rrcf, oversampling=samples_per_symbol))\nprint(\"Empirical ACLR (db):\", aclr_db)\n\n# Compare with the theoretical ACLR\nprint(\"Filter ACLR (dB)\", 10*np.log10(rrcf.aclr))\n```\n\nIn this code, `x_rrcf` is the transmitted signal and `samples_per_symbol` is the oversampling factor. The `aclr` property is accessed from the `rrcf` object, which is an instance of the `RootRaisedCosineFilter` class."}]}

This simulation takes into consideration various parameters of the optical signal, such as attenuation coefficient, Group velocity dispersion coefficient, carrier frequency, Nonlinearity coefficient, fiber length, and a range of other properties which impact the simulation result.\n\nLastly, note that the SSFM can operate under either a single-polarized or dual-polarized mode. The dual-polarized mode is operated through the Manakov equation, and is determined by the \"with_manakov\" parameter.\n\nThese are seen when setting up the SSFM in the Sionna package as follows:\n\n```python\nspan = sionna.channel.optical.SSFM(\n                         alpha=0.046,\n                         beta_2=-21.67,\n                         f_c=193.55e12,\n                         gamma=1.27,\n                         length=80,\n                         n_ssfm=200,\n                         n_sp=1.0,\n                         t_norm=1e-12,\n                         with_amplification=False,\n                         with_attenuation=True,\n                         with_dispersion=True,\n                         with_nonlinearity=True,\n                         dtype=tf.complex64)\n```\nIn the simulation, the SSFM is used to simulate the signal transmission over a given number of fiber spans, with each span followed by amplification through EDFA, and the complete transmission can be simulated like so:\n\n```python\ny = simulate_transmission(x, n_span)\n```\nWhere 'x' represents the optical input signal and 'n_span' is the number of spans."}]}

This means that the scramblers do not maintain any internal states with respect to time and different calls to scramblers will not depend on previous calls. \n\nThis stateless characteristic of the scramblers refers to the handling of the random seed in scrambling operations. The internal seed, which determines the specific randomness pattern, cannot be updated during runtime and does not change after initialization.\n\nThe Descrambler, Scrambler, and TB5GScrambler are all stateless modules of Sionna's FEC (Forward Error Correction) scrambling system. For instance, when a Scrambler is initialized with a certain seed and binary flag, the scrambling operation will be the same for any input sequence. \n\nHere is an example using Scrambler and Descrambler:\n```python\nscrambler = Scrambler(seed=1234,binary=True) \ndescrambler = Descrambler(scrambler=scrambler)\nc_scr = scrambler(c)\nc_descr = descrambler(c_scr)\n```\nIn the above example, a Scrambler is set up with a seed of 1234 and a binary flag set to True. Then the Descrambler is initialized using the same scrambler, hence it has the same scrambling operation as the scrambler. The scrambling operation is applied to an input sequence c and then descrambled again to get the original sequence.\n\nSimilarly, TB5GScrambler, which enables 5G NR compliant scrambling, also follows stateless behavior.\n\nUltimately, making scramblers stateless is convenient for distributed graph execution where scramblers and descramblers might be run in different sub-graphs or devices.\n\nPlease note that for actual application, you would need to replace 'c' in the code with your binary sequence. The 'c' here is just a placeholder representing a binary sequence input."}]}

It can be one of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'E'.\n\n2. `delay_spread`: A float which indicates the RMS delay or 'spread' of the simulated channel in seconds.\n\n3. `carrier_frequency`: This is the carrier frequency for the wireless channel in Hertz.\n\n4. `ut_array` and `bs_array`: These are instances of the PanelArray class used to create models of panel arrays used by the user terminals (UTs) and base stations (BSs).\n\n5. `direction`: This is a string, either \"uplink\" or \"downlink\", specifying the link direction.\n\n6. `min_speed` and `max_speed`: These specify the minimum and maximum speed of the user terminals (UTs). By default, `min_speed` is 0.0, and `max_speed` is None, indicating no mobility.\n\n7. `dtype`: Defines the datatype for internal calculations and the output dtype. Defaults to tf.complex64.\n\n\nAfter initializing the CDL object, when the instance is called with `batch_size`, `num_time_steps`, and `sampling_frequency` as parameters, output received is a tuple containing path coefficients of the channel response and path delays.\n\nSo, in summary, setting up a CDL class will involve creating an instance of the PanelArray class for the transmitters (BSs) and receivers (UTs), then initializing the CDL class with its necessary parameters."}]}

The function `initialize_all_zero_encoder` is defined to accept two parameters, `k` and `n`.\n2. Three assertions are made:\n    - `k` is a positive integer.\n    - `n` is a positive integer.\n    - `k` is less than or equal to `n`.\n3. If the input values do not satisfy these conditions, an `AssertionError` with an appropriate message will be raised.\n4. Otherwise, an `AllZeroEncoder` instance is initialized with the provided `k` and `n` values.\n\nPlease make sure that appropriate values are passed for `k` and `n` to prevent the `AssertionError` from being raised. The example usage demonstrates how the function can be used with hypothetical values for `k` and `n`.

This is a method for checking errors during data transmission. To understand the role and functionality of the `property` objects of this class, let's break each of them down:\n\n1. `crc_degree`: This property represents the CRC degree as a string. The degree denotes the number of added parity bits and is taken from the 3GPP 5G NR standard. The available values for `crc_degree` are: CRC24A, CRC24B, CRC24C, CRC16, CRC11, CRC6.\n\n2. `crc_length`: As its name indicates, `crc_length` represents the length of the CRC, which is equal to the number of CRC parity bits. Parity bits are a simple form of error detection codes that ensure the number of ones in the set (i.e., in the code words and the parity bit) are even or odd.\n\n3. `crc_pol`: This property stands for the CRC polynomial in binary representation. In the context of CRC, a polynomial is used to divide the message and obtain the remainder, which is then transmitted along with the message. `crc_pol` represents this polynomial.\n\n4. `k`: This represents the number of information bits per codeword. A codeword in this context is a sequence of bits which includes sequence information and parity bits.\n\n5. `n`: This property corresponds to the total number of codeword bits. It is generally the sum of the number of information bits `k` and the number of parity bits.\n\nIt's important to note that for performance enhancements, the CRCEncoder class implements a generator-matrix based implementation for fixed `k`, instead of the more common shift register-based operations. Consequently, if `k` changes, the encoder will trigger an internal rebuild."}]}

This is particularly useful for adapting the bandwidth efficiency of the code to different channel conditions or system requirements. \n\nThe `puncture_pattern` function takes two arguments: `turbo_coderate` and `conv_coderate`. The first argument, `turbo_coderate`, specifies the desired coderate of the Turbo code after puncturing. The second argument, `conv_coderate`, is the coderate of the underlying convolutional encoder(s) used within the Turbo encoder before puncturing.\n\nThe function operates by determining which bits in the Turbo codeword to omit to achieve the desired `turbo_coderate`. The convolutional coders used as components of the Turbo coder typically have a coderate of 1/2, meaning that for each input bit, there are two output bits (including both data and parity bits). When these are combined in a Turbo code configuration, the initial Turbo coderate without puncturing is generally 1/3.\n\nTo adjust the coderate from the natural rate of the Turbo code (e.g., 1/3) to the desired rate (e.g., 1/2), the `puncture_pattern` function calculates a pattern that specifies which bits to keep (\"1\") and which bits to puncture or remove (\"0\"). The output of the function is a tensor indicating the positions to be punctured in order to attain the desired Turbo code rate.\n\nPlease note that this function relies on particular implementations of the Turbo code structure and its associated puncturing patterns. Therefore, without access to the implementation details of the `puncture_pattern` function in the Sionna library, it is not possible to provide the exact methodology it uses. However, the general approach described above would typically be how a puncturing pattern is determined for Turbo codes.\n\nFor further insight into how the `puncture_pattern` function is actually implemented or used within Sionna, one would need access to documentation or source code from Sionna for this specific function, as my explanation is based on general Turbo coding principles.\n\nTo use this function with the Sionna APIs, you would import the specific utility function from the Turbo coding submodule:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.turbo.utils import puncture_pattern\n```\n\nThen, you would call this function with the desired code rates:\n\n```python\n# Desired Turbo code rate (code_rate) and convolutional code rate (conv_code_rate)\nturbo_coderate = 1/2\nconv_coderate = 1/2 \n\n# Generate the puncture pattern\npct_pattern = puncture_pattern(turbo_coderate, conv_coderate)\n```\n\nWhere `turbo_coderate` would be the target rate for the Turbo code, and `conv_coderate` would be the coderate of the convolutional codes before puncturing."}]}

Import the necessary modules and set up the environment. This includes importing the Sionna package and setting up the GPU configuration.\n\n2. Load the scene for ray tracing. You can use the `load_scene` function from the Sionna RT module to load the scene. The scene can be an external file or one of the integrated scenes.\n\n3. Configure the antenna array for all transmitters and receivers using the `PlanarArray` class. You can specify the number of rows and columns, spacing, pattern, and polarization.\n\n4. Create and add transmitters and receivers to the scene using the `Transmitter` and `Receiver` classes. Each transmitter and receiver needs a unique name, a position, and orientation.\n\n5. Set the carrier frequency of the scene and implicitly update all RadioMaterials.\n\n6. Run the ray tracing process and compute propagation paths between all transmitters and receivers using the `compute_paths` function. The `max_depth` parameter determines the maximum number of interactions between a ray and a scene object.\n\n7. Transform the computed paths into channel impulse responses (CIRs) using the `cir` method of the `Paths` object. This generates the CIRs which can be used by other components for link-level simulations in either time or frequency domains.\n\n8. Compute the frequency response of the channel at frequencies using the `cir_to_ofdm_channel` function.\n\n9. Use the frequency responses in the link-level simulations. For example, you can use the `ApplyOFDMChannel` layer to apply the channel to the transmitted signal.\n\n10.

Apply the matched filter to the waveform. In this context, the matched filter is the same as the pulse-shaping filter used in the transmission process. This can be done using the RootRaisedCosineFilter function from the Sionna signal module. The filter is applied to the waveform by calling the filter function with the waveform as the argument.\n\n```python\nx_mf = rrcf(x_rrcf)\n```\n\n2. After applying the matched filter, downsample the result. This is done using the Downsampling function from the Sionna signal module. The Downsampling function requires three arguments: the number of samples per symbol, the filter length minus one, and the number of symbols. The downsampling process starts from the correct index, which can be obtained as the filter length minus one.\n\n```python\nds = Downsampling(samples_per_symbol, rrcf.length-1, num_symbols)\nx_hat = ds(x_mf)\n```\n\n3.

There are three different types of scramblers: `Scrambler`, `TB5GScrambler`, and `Descrambler`.\n\nHere is a brief breakdown of how each works.\n\n### Scrambler\n\nFirst, you initialize your `Scrambler` with the desired settings:\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.scrambling import Scrambler\n\nscrambler = Scrambler(seed=1234, binary=True)\n```\nWhere `seed` is an explicit seed for the random generator and `binary` indicates whether bits should be flipped or not.\n\nTo use the scrambler, call it with your binary sequence `c`:\n```python\nc_scr = scrambler(c)\n```\nIf the sequence `c` is arbitrary and contains values other than 0s and 1s, you should set `binary=False` while initializing the scrambler.\n\n### Descrambler\n\nTo descramble your scrambled sequence back to the initial sequence, you can use the `Descrambler`. First, you need to initialize the descrambler with your scrambler:\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.scrambling import Descrambler\n\ndescrambler = Descrambler(scrambler=scrambler)\n```\nAnd then, call it with the scrambled sequence:\n```python\nc_descr = descrambler(c_scr)\n```\nThis will give you back the original order of your binary sequence.\n\n### TB5GScrambler\n\nThe `TB5GScrambler` is a specific scrambler for 5G NR compliant scrambling. You can initialize and use it similar to the `Scrambler`. Here is an example:\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.scrambling import TB5GScrambler\n\ntb5g_scrambler = TB5GScrambler(n_rnti=1, n_id=1, binary=True)\n\nc_scr = tb5g_scrambler(c)\n```"}]}

Identify the rotation matrix that represents the rotation from the first coordinate system to the second. This matrix, denoted as R(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), is expressed as a combination of rotations around the z, y, and x axes.\n\n2. Apply the inverse of the rotation matrix to the point in the first coordinate system. This transforms the point to the second coordinate system. The transformed point is represented as x' = R^T(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)x.\n\n3. The spherical angles (\u03b8', \u03c6') in the second coordinate system can be found using the following formulas:\n\n    \u03b8' = cos^(-1)(z^T R^T(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) r(\u03b8, \u03c6))\n    \n    \u03c6' = arg((x + jy)^T R^T(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) r(\u03b8, \u03c6))\n\nHere, r(\u03b8, \u03c6) is the unit vector in the direction of the point in the first coordinate system, and x, y, z are the Cartesian coordinates of the point. The function arg() is the argument of a complex number, which can be computed using the atan2 function.\n\nNote: The above explanation is based on the context provided, which assumes a 3D rotation with yaw, pitch, and roll angles \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, respectively. The rotation matrices R_z(\u03b1), R_y(\u03b2), and R_x(\u03b3) are defined in the context. The inverse of a rotation matrix is its transpose, and the spherical unit vectors are also defined in the context."}]}

The CRC degree defines the type of CRC polynomial to be used and can be any of the types defined in the 3GPP 5G NR standard: {CRC24A, CRC24B, CRC24C, CRC16, CRC11, CRC6}.\n\n2. `encoder`: This property points to the associated `CRCEncoder` instance used for internal validations.

The matrix should consist only of 0s or 1s. The matrix can also be of type `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` or `scipy.sparse.csc_matrix`. This matrix represents the connection between check nodes and variable nodes in the LDPC graph.\n\n- **trainable** (`bool`, default `False`): If set to `True`, the decoder will use trainable weights for outgoing variable node messages, facilitating the use of deep learning techniques to optimize decoding performance.\n\n- **cn_type** (`str`, default `'boxplus-phi'`): This parameter specifies the type of check node update function used in the belief propagation algorithm. Possible values are `'boxplus'`, `'boxplus-phi'`, and `'minsum'`. The default `'boxplus-phi'` uses an approach that is numerically more stable.\n\n- **hard_out** (`bool`, default `True`): If set to `True`, the decoder will output hard decision values for the codeword bits. If `False`, soft estimates of the codeword bits are produced.\n\n- **track_exit** (`bool`, default `False`): If set to `True`, the decoder tracks EXIT (extrinsic information transfer) characteristics which is useful for analysis and optimization of the decoder's performance.\n\n- **num_iter** (`int`, default `20`): Defines the number of decoding iterations. This is the number of times the belief propagation algorithm will iterate to attempt to decode the received message.\n\n- **stateful** (`bool`, default `False`): If set to `True`, the decoder will return the intermediate variable node messages from the last decoding iteration, allowing for iterative decoding processes.\n\n- **output_dtype** (`tf.DType`, default `tf.float32`): Specifies the datatype of the decoder's output. The library might support various Tensorflow data types such as `tf.float16`, `tf.float32`, and `tf.float64`.\n\n- **kwargs**: Additional optional parameters that may be accepted by the decoder, depending on the specific configuration and extensions of the LDPC decoder.\n\nThis decoder is suitable for generic belief propagation decoding of codes represented by arbitrary parity-check matrices and can be incorporated into a TensorFlow/Keras model as a layer. It's important to note that the provided parity-check matrix must comply with the code's structure and, for 5G NR compatibility, should reflect any puncturing and shortening as required by the communication standard."}]}

Here are the steps:\n\n1. First, you need to create a coverage map. This can be done using the `coverage_map` function of the scene object. This function takes parameters like `max_depth`, `diffraction`, `cm_cell_size`, `combining_vec`, `precoding_vec`, and `num_samples`.\n\n```python\ncm = scene.coverage_map(max_depth=5,\n                        diffraction=True,\n                        cm_cell_size=(1., 1.),\n                        combining_vec=None,\n                        precoding_vec=None,\n                        num_samples=int(10e6))\n```\n\n2.

The `sample_positions` function returns an array of positions. You can then use these positions to create receivers at these positions in the scene.\n\n```python\nfor idx in range(batch_size_cir):\n    rx = Receiver(name=f\"rx-{idx}\",\n                  position=ue_pos[idx])\n    scene.add(rx)\n```\n\nPlease note that the actual code may vary depending on the specific requirements of your simulation."}]}

Now, you can use the created BitErrorRate object to compute the average bit error rate (BER) between two binary tensors. The function is expected to take two arguments, both of which must be TensorFlow tensors filled with ones and zeros.\n    \n    ```python\n    result = ber_metric(b, b_hat)\n    ```\n   Here, `b` and `b_hat` are binary tensors of the same shape. \n\nPlease note that you need to replace <'desired_name'> with the actual string value you want to use as the name for the class instance, and kwargs with actual keyword arguments as per your needs.\n\nAlso, ensure that you install the necessary 'sionna' package and its dependencies before running the code."}]}

Here is a general step-by-step guide:\n\n1. First, ensure that you have imported the necessary libraries and packages. This includes Sionna, matplotlib for plotting, and other necessary packages like numpy and tensorflow.\n\n```python\nimport sionna\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\n```\n\n2. Run your simulation and store the results in a variable. The simulation process will depend on your specific use case and the Sionna functions you are using.\n\n3. Once you have the results of your simulation, you can use the built-in plotting functions in Sionna to visualize the results. For example, if you have simulated a 16-QAM constellation, you can use the `show()` function of the `Constellation` class to visualize it:\n\n```python\nconstellation = sionna.mapping.Constellation(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol=4)\nconstellation.show();\n```\n\n4. If you have results from a Bit-Error Rate (BER) Monte-Carlo simulation, you can use the `plot_ber()` function from the `sionna.utils.plotting` module to plot the BER against the SNR:\n\n```python\nsionna.utils.plotting.plot_ber(ebno_dbs, ber_mc, legend=\"E2E Model\", ylabel=\"Coded BER\");\n```\n\nIn this example, `ebno_dbs` is the range of SNR values, and `ber_mc` is the corresponding BER values from the Monte-Carlo simulation.\n\nRemember to replace the variables and parameters in the code snippets with those that match your specific use case."}]}

First, import the necessary libraries and modules. This includes TensorFlow, numpy, matplotlib, and several modules from the Sionna package. \n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.utils import BinarySource, QAMSource, ebnodb2no, compute_ser, compute_ber, PlotBER\nfrom sionna.channel import FlatFadingChannel, KroneckerModel\nfrom sionna.channel.utils import exp_corr_mat\nfrom sionna.mimo import lmmse_equalizer\nfrom sionna.mapping import SymbolDemapper, Mapper, Demapper\nfrom sionna.fec.ldpc.encoding import LDPC5GEncoder\nfrom sionna.fec.ldpc.decoding import LDPC5GDecoder\n```\n\n2. Set up the transmitter and receiver antennas, and generate a batch of random transmit vectors of random 16QAM symbols.\n\n```python\nnum_tx_ant = 4\nnum_rx_ant = 16\nnum_bits_per_symbol = 4\nbatch_size = 1024\nqam_source = QAMSource(num_bits_per_symbol)\nx = qam_source([batch_size, num_tx_ant])\n```\n\n3. Create an instance of the `FlatFadingChannel` class to simulate transmissions over an i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel. The channel will also add AWGN with variance `no`. \n\n```python\nchannel = FlatFadingChannel(num_tx_ant, num_rx_ant, add_awgn=True, return_channel=True)\nno = 0.2 # Noise variance of the channel\ny, h = channel([x, no])\n```\n\n4. Implement the LMMSE equalizer. The noise covariance matrix in this example is just a scaled identity matrix which we need to provide to the `lmmse_equalizer`.\n\n```python\ns = tf.cast(no*tf.eye(num_rx_ant, num_rx_ant), y.dtype)\nx_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s)\n```\n\n5. Plot the transmitted and received constellations.\n\n```python\nplt.axes().set_aspect(1.0)\nplt.scatter(np.real(x_hat), np.imag(x_hat))\nplt.scatter(np.real(x), np.imag(x))\n```\n\n6. The soft symbols `x_hat` are scattered around the 16QAM constellation points. The equalizer output `no_eff` provides an estimate of the effective noise variance for each soft-symbol.\n\n7. Make hard decisions on the symbols and compute the SER.\n\n```python\nsymbol_demapper = SymbolDemapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol, hard_out=True)\nx_ind = symbol_demapper([x, no])\nx_ind_hat = symbol_demapper([x_hat, no])\ncompute_ser(x_ind, x_ind_hat)\n```\n\nThis is a basic implementation of an LMMSE equalizer to compute soft-symbols. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to adjust parameters or add additional steps."}]}

Then, you can call the `generate_out_int` static method by providing the desired output sequence length (`n`) and the number of bits per QAM symbol (`num_bits_per_symbol`).\n\nHere is a code snippet that demonstrates the usage of the `generate_out_int` method:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.ldpc.encoding import LDPC5GEncoder\n\n# Desired length of the output sequence and number of bits per QAM symbol\nn = 200  # This should match the 'n' used for an actual LDPC5GEncoder instance\nnum_bits_per_symbol = 2  # Example value, actual value depends on the modulation scheme\n\n# Create instance and then generate the interleaver sequence using the method\nencoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k = 100, # number of information bits (input)\n                        n = 200) # number of codeword bits (output)\nperm_seq, perm_seq_inv = encoder.generate_out_int(n, num_bits_per_symbol)\n\n# Now perm_seq and perm_seq_inv contain the interleaver sequences.\n```\n\nThe variables `perm_seq` and `perm_seq_inv` will hold the interleaver sequence and its inverse, which can then be used in rate-matching procedures as defined in the 5G NR standard.\n\nPlease ensure that the actual values of `n` and `num_bits_per_symbol` you use are appropriate for the LDPC code configuration you are working with. In this example, `num_bits_per_symbol` is set to 2, which corresponds to QPSK; for other modulation schemes, this value would differ."}]}

It is suitable for large scenes but doesn't guarantee that all possible paths are found. Defaults to \"fibonacci\".\n- `num_samples` (int): Number of random rays traced to generate candidates, applicable only if the method is \"fibonacci\". A high number of samples may exhaust GPU memory. Defaults to 1,000,000.\n- `los` (bool): If `True`, Line-of-Sight (LoS) paths are computed.

Defaults to False.\n- `scattering` (bool): If `True`, scattered paths are computed, but only with the \"fibonacci\" method. Defaults to False.\n- `scat_keep_prob` (float): Probability of retaining a scattered path, useful for managing the number of paths in complex scenes. Must be between 0 and 1. Defaults to 0.001.\n- `edge_diffraction` (bool): If `False`, considers only diffraction on wedges, i.e., edges connecting two primitives.

Import the relevant function from the Sionna library:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.utils import generate_5g_ranking\n```\n\n2. Determine the parameters `k` and `n` for your use case:\n\n- `k`: The number of information bits per codeword you want to encode.\n- `n`: The desired length of the codeword. Must be a power of two.\n\n3. Call the `generate_5g_ranking` function with the `sort` parameter:\n\n```python\nk = 100  # example value for the number of information bits\nn = 256  # example value for the length of the codeword\n\n# Generate the information and frozen bit positions\nfrozen_pos, info_pos = generate_5g_ranking(k, n, sort=True)\n```\n\nUnderstanding the `sort` parameter:\n- The `sort` parameter dictates whether the returned indices should be sorted. By default, it is set to `True`.\n    - When `sort` is `True`, the function returns the frozen and information bit indices sorted in ascending order.\n    - When `sort` is `False`, the indices are returned based on the reliability ordering specific to the Polar code design specified in 3GPP TS 38.212 for 5G communications.\n\n4. Use the returned `frozen_pos` and `info_pos` in your coding scheme:\n- `frozen_pos` includes the positions of the codeword bits that are predetermined (frozen) and known to both the encoder and decoder.\n- `info_pos` includes the positions of the codeword bits that will carry the actual information.\n\n5. The choice of the `sort` parameter may affect further operations, such as encoding and decoding:\n- If you require the indices to adhere to their reliability ordering as per the 5G standards, set `sort=False`.\n- For simplified handling or custom implementations where sort order is important, you might opt for `sort=True`.\n\nRemember that the `generate_5g_ranking` function has certain constraints on `k` and `n`, such as requiring `n` to be a power of two, and both `k` and `n` to be within specific bounds. The function will raise an `AssertionError` if these constraints are not met."}]}

Then, if a new random seed should be used for each call, you need to generate it. Signal to be scrambled is `c` (say, a binary sequence). You can generate the seed using TensorFlow's `random.uniform` function. Then, pass the signal and the seed as a list to both scrambler and descrambler:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ns = tf.random.uniform((), minval=0, maxval=12345678, dtype=tf.int32) # explicit random seed\n# Define c as a random binary tensor with arbitrary shape\n# Here, creating it directly as tf.float32\nc = tf.random.uniform(shape=(100,), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.float32)  # Adjust shape as needed\nc_scr = scrambler([c, s])     # scrambled signal\nc_descr = descrambler([c_scr, s])  # descrambled signal\n```\nIn the above block, the seed `s` is chosen randomly between 0 and 12345678. The scrambler takes the input as a list of the data (`c`) and the seed (`s`). The descrambler also takes the input as a list of the scrambled data (`c_scr`) and the same seed (`s`). By using the same seed, the descrambler can accurately reconstruct the original order of `c`.\n\nNote: This assumes that your working environment supports Tensorflow and Sionna APIs.

The scene can calculate paths, channel impulse responses (CIRs), and coverage maps based on the layout of these elements.\n  - **Cameras**: Used for visualization and rendering purposes.\n  - **Materials**: Defined for each scene object to simulate radio wave interactions such as reflection, absorption, and scattering.\n- **Dynamic Settings**:\n  - The carrier frequency can be adjusted, which in turn updates the properties of frequency-dependent materials.\n  - Antenna arrays can be applied either realistically or synthetically, affecting how the simulations compute antenna interactions.\n- **Computational Methods**:\n  - **Path Tracing**: For calculating the paths of radio waves through the scene considering multiple interactions like reflections and diffractions.\n  - **Field Computation**: Converts traced paths into electromagnetic fields for further analysis.\n  - **Coverage Map Computation**: Calculates signal strength over a specified area, providing insight into the effective coverage of transmitters.\n\n### Usage:\n\nThe class is designed to be highly flexible, allowing users to load specific scenes from files, add or remove elements dynamically, and compute various simulation metrics based on the configured environment.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that simulations can be both accurate and efficient, leveraging detailed control over each component within the scene."}]}

For example, when simulating a communication system, each batch could represent a different set of system parameters or a different set of input data. By processing these batches independently and in parallel, Sionna can significantly speed up the simulation process.\n\nThis concept is particularly important in the context of machine learning and deep learning, where large amounts of data need to be processed.

Part of the energy of the wave gets reflected, while the other part gets refracted, or propagates into the surface. There are two types of reflection: specular and diffuse.\n\nSpecular reflection occurs when a ray hits a surface and is reflected in a single direction. This is the type of reflection you would see in a mirror, where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\n\nDiffuse reflection, also known as diffuse scattering, occurs when a ray hits a surface and is scattered in many different directions. This is the type of reflection you would see on a rough surface, like a wall or a piece of paper. \n\nIn the context of ray tracing, the key difference between specular and diffuse reflections is that an incoming ray spawns infinitely many scattered rays in the case of diffuse reflection, while there is only a single specular path. To compute the scattered field at a particular position, one needs to integrate the scattered field over the entire surface.\n\nThe scattering pattern of a surface element determines the scattered field. The scattered field can be stronger in certain directions than others. For example, in the Lambertian scattering pattern, the scattered field is equally likely in all directions. In the Directive scattering pattern, the scattered field is more concentrated around the specular direction.\n\nIn a complex scene with many scattering surfaces, scattering can play an important role in determining the coverage of a signal. The effects of scattering can be observed in coverage maps, which describe the average received power from a specific transmitter at every point on a plane. \n\nIn conclusion, scattering is an important phenomenon in radio propagation modelling, especially at higher frequencies where surfaces appear rougher compared to the wavelength."}]}

The LLR values typically come from a demodulator, which decodes the physical signal into a form that can be processed by the decoder:\n\n   ```python\n   # Assuming `llr_ch` is a tensor containing LLRs with shape [..., n]\n   ```\n\n4. Run the `OSDecoder` on the LLR values. The output will be the hard decisions of the decoder (in binary form) for the transmitted codeword:\n\n   ```python\n   c_hat = decoder(llr_ch)\n   ```\n\n   The variable `c_hat` will contain the binary hard-decisions of the codeword bits.\n\nThese steps cover the main processes to be executed when using the `OSDecoder` with LLR values as input. However, understanding the specific aspects and nuances of your application might require additional operations, error handling, or initialization details.\n\nMake sure you verify and comply with the input requirements of the `OSDecoder`. For instance, your input LLR tensor must have a compatible shape, and the parity-check or generator matrix must adhere to the specifications (e.g., binary, of full rank). If there are any other requirements or adjustments needed for your particular use case, please ensure to account for them in your implementation."}]}

Create an instance of the `Polar5GEncoder` class by specifying the necessary parameters, such as the number of information bits `k` and the number of codeword bits `n`. For example:\n```python\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=100, n=200)\n```\n\n3. Once you have the encoder instance, you can create an instance of the `Polar5GDecoder` class by passing the encoder instance to its constructor, along with other necessary parameters. The `enc_polar` parameter is used to provide the encoder instance to the decoder. Additionally, specify the type of decoder (`dec_type`) and, if it's a list decoder, the list size (`list_size`). For example:\n```python\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(enc_polar=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nBy doing this, you connect the decoder to the encoder, which allows the decoder to use the relevant encoding configuration information for the decoding process, such as the frozen positions of the Polar code.\n\nEnsure you have installed the Sionna library and imported the right classes before running this code. If any parameters need to be specified or adjusted according to the code requirement or simulation setup, make sure to do so. Also, be mindful that the `dec_type` can be set to `SC`, `SCL`, or `BP` for successive cancellation, successive cancellation list, or belief propagation decoding, respectively, and the `list_size` should be specified as applicable for list decoders."}]}

Glavieux, P. Thitimajshima, Near Shannon limit error-correcting coding and decoding: Turbo-codes, IEEE ICC, 1993]](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/fec.turbo.html#berrou). Berrou's work, alongside A. Glavieux and P. Thitimajshima, paved the way for a class of codes that approach the Shannon limit, which implies that they are highly effective in correcting errors while using minimal additional data. Their invention of Turbo codes represents a major leap in communication systems' efficiency, and these codes have been implemented widely in various standards, including those for mobile communication.\n\nThe 3GPP TS 36.212 specification is highly relevant to Turbo coding, as it defines the multiplexing and channel coding for the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (EUTRA) used in LTE. This specification includes the standards for Turbo codes, ensuring that devices remain compatible and performant across the LTE network. The specification [[3GPPTS36212_Turbo]](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/fec.turbo.html#gppts36212-turbo) prescribes crucial details such as the interleaver pattern and termination schemes that are important for Turbo code operations in LTE.\n\nIn the given context, there are references to Sionna APIs pertaining to Turbo coding, including `TurboEncoder` and `TurboDecoder`, which are critical when implementing the Turbo code structure as per the 3GPP standards. These APIs provide functionalities for handling the encoding and decoding process of Turbo codes in line with LTE requirements. For instance, the `TurboEncoder` can accept generator polynomials in binary format, a format consistent with the polynomials specified by the 3GPP TS 36.212 standard.\n\nWhen referencing Sionna APIs, it is important to use the exact package and class names as they appear in the documentation. For instance, the correct imports to use these functionalities in Python would be:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.turbo import TurboEncoder, TurboDecoder, TurboTermination\nfrom sionna.fec.turbo.utils import polynomial_selector, puncture_pattern\n``` \n\nThese imports provide access to various classes and utilities in Sionna's Turbo coding implementation that are designed to adhere to specifications like those found in 3GPP TS 36.212."}]}

You can import them using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\nimport sionna as sn\n```\n\n2. **Define your model**: You can define your model as a class that inherits from the Keras `Model` class. In the `__init__()` method of your class, you can instantiate the components of your model. For example, if you're building a communication system, you might instantiate a mapper, a demapper, a binary source, and an AWGN channel. In the `__call__()` method of your class, you can define the forward pass through your system.\n\nHere's an example of how you might define a simple uncoded transmission system over an AWGN channel:\n\n```python\nclass UncodedSystemAWGN(Model):\n    def __init__(self, num_bits_per_symbol, block_length):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.num_bits_per_symbol = num_bits_per_symbol\n        self.block_length = block_length\n        self.constellation = sn.mapping.Constellation(\"qam\", self.num_bits_per_symbol)\n        self.mapper = sn.mapping.Mapper(constellation=self.constellation)\n        self.demapper = sn.mapping.Demapper(\"app\", constellation=self.constellation)\n        self.binary_source = sn.utils.BinarySource()\n        self.awgn_channel = sn.channel.AWGN()\n\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=self.num_bits_per_symbol, coderate=1.0)\n        bits = self.binary_source([batch_size, self.block_length])\n        x = self.mapper(bits)\n        y = self.awgn_channel([x, no])\n        llr = self.demapper([y, no])\n        return bits, llr\n```\n\n3. **Instantiate and use your model**: Once you've defined your model, you can instantiate it and use it to simulate your system. For example, you might use it to simulate the bit error rate (BER) of your system over a range of SNR values.\n\nRemember that Sionna inherently parallelizes simulations via batching, so each element in the batch dimension is simulated independently. This means you can simulate multiple examples in parallel by using a larger batch size.\n\nNote: The provided context does not provide specific details on how to use the Keras functional API to build complex systems in Sionna.

Load your scene and configure your transmitter and receiver arrays.\n\n```python\nscene = load_scene(sionna.rt.scene.simple_reflector)\nscene.tx_array = PlanarArray(1,1,0.5,0.5,\"iso\",\"V\")\nscene.rx_array = scene.tx_array\n```\n\n3.

Now you can apply the Doppler shift to the paths. You need to specify the sampling frequency, the number of time steps, and the velocity vectors of the transmitter and receiver.\n\n```python\ntx_velocity = [30,0,0]\npaths.apply_doppler(sampling_frequency=1/rg.ofdm_symbol_duration,\n                    num_time_steps=rg.num_ofdm_symbols,\n                    tx_velocities=tx_velocity)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `apply_doppler` method is used to compute the time evolution of the channel impulse response based on the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift is calculated based on the velocity vectors of the scene objects. The `apply_doppler` method updates the path delays and path coefficients (`Paths.tau` and `Paths.a`) to reflect the time evolution of the channel."}]}

First, you need to simulate the CIRs for many different random positions. This can be done using the `compute_paths` function from the Sionna RT module. This function computes the propagation paths between all transmitters and receivers in the scene.\n\n2. Once you have the paths, you can transform them into CIRs using the `cir` function from the Paths object. This function generates the channel impulse responses which can be used for link-level simulations.\n\n3. After obtaining the CIRs, you can initialize a data generator. In the context provided, a class `CIRGenerator` is defined for this purpose. This class creates a generator from a given dataset of channel impulse responses. The generator samples `num_tx` different transmitters from the given path coefficients `a` and path delays `tau` and stacks the CIRs into a single tensor.\n\n4.

It works by adding parity bits to the data being transmitted. These parity bits are calculated based on the data itself, and are used for verifying the integrity of the data when it is received.\n\nThe process of adding these parity bits is implemented using the `CRCEncoder` class from the Sionna library. To create an instance of a `CRCEncoder`, you need to specify the `crc_degree` parameter, which is equivalent to the number of parity bits to add, based on the 3GPP 5G NR standard. Here's a python code snippet on how you might do it:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.crc import CRCEncoder\nencoder = CRCEncoder(crc_degree=\"CRC24A\") \n```\n\nSubsequently, to use the `CRCEncoder` to add CRC parity bits to a bit sequence `u`, you can call it like a function:\n\n```python\n# u contains the information bits to be encoded and has shape [...,k].\n# c contains u and the CRC parity bits. It has shape [...,k+k_crc].\nc = encoder(u) \n```\n\nHere, `u` is the bit sequence to be encoded, `c` then contains both the original bit sequence `u` and the added CRC parity bits.\n\nTo validate whether the data received with parity bits is valid, you utilize the `CRCDecoder` class. This requires an instance of `CRCEncoder` associated with the encoder. You would create an instance like this:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.crc import CRCDecoder\ndecoder = CRCDecoder(crc_encoder=encoder) \n```\n\nTo carry out the validation check, you feed the bit sequence with parity bits to the `CRCDecoder`:\n\n```python\n# u_hat contains the information bits without parity bits and has shape [...,k].\n# crc_valid contains a boolean per codeword that indicates if the CRC validation was successful.\n# It has shape [...,1].\nu_hat, crc_valid = decoder(c) \n```\n\n`u_hat` contains the original bit sequence without the parity bits and `crc_valid` is a boolean that indicates if the CRC validation was successful.

In a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check), parity bits are added to detect any transmission errors, ensuring the integrity of data. The CRCEncoder class is specifically purposed to add these cyclic redundancy checks to input sequences effectively.\n\nIts methods have implemented a generator-matrix-based operation as opposed to the more conventional shift register-based operation. Taking this novel approach provides performance enhancements by exploiting matrix-based computation methodologies that often deliver advantages in computational speed.\n\nThe information bits input (marked as 'u' or 'k') play a critical role in the operation of the encoder. When 'k' changes, the analysis generated by the matrix for the existing 'k' would no longer apply to the new 'k'. The generator matrix is specific for the given 'k', and hence if the input 'k' changes, an internal rebuild has to be triggered in the encoder to create a new generator matrix appropriate for the new 'k'. This ensures the accuracy and efficiency of encoding operations. \n\nKeeping the performance at optimal levels not only reduces computation load and time, but also ensures precision in the CRC parity bit addition process, thus maintaining consistency in encoding process for varied information bit size. \n\nIn summary, performance enhancements in the CRCEncoder class are integral to maximizing the efficiency of the CRC process.

Fu and J. S. Thompson, \u201cPerformance analysis of K-best detection with adaptive modulation\u201d, IEEE Int. Symp. Wirel. Commun. Sys. (ISWCS), 2015.]. It can either generate hard decisions (for symbols or bits) or compute LLRs.\n\nThe algorithm operates in either the complex or real-valued domain. Although both options produce identical results, the former has the advantage that it can be applied to arbitrary non-QAM constellations. It also reduces the number of streams (or depth) by a factor of two.\n\nThe way soft-outputs (i.e., LLRs) are computed is determined by the list2llr function. The default solution List2LLRSimple assigns a predetermined value to all LLRs without counter-hypothesis.\n\nThis layer assumes the following channel model: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{n}$ where $\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{C}^M$ is the received signal vector, $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{C}^S$  is the vector of transmitted symbols which are uniformly and independently drawn from the constellation $\\mathcal{C}$, $\\mathbf{H}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{M\\times S}$ is the known channel matrix, and $\\mathbf{n}\\in\\mathbb{C}^M$ is a complex Gaussian noise vector. It is assumed that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{n}\\right]=\\mathbf{0}$ and $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{n}\\mathbf{n}^{\\mathsf{H}}\\right]=\\mathbf{S}$, where $\\mathbf{S}$ has full rank.\n\nIn a first optional step, the channel model is converted to its real-valued equivalent, see complex2real_channel(). We assume in the sequel the complex-valued representation. Then, the channel is whitened using whiten_channel(): \n$\\begin{split}\\tilde{\\mathbf{y}} &= \\mathbf{S}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\mathbf{y}\\\\\n&=  \\mathbf{S}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{S}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\mathbf{n}\\\\\n&= \\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}\\mathbf{x} + \\tilde{\\mathbf{n}}.\\end{split}$\n\nNext, the columns of $\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}$ are sorted according to their norm in descending order. Then, the QR decomposition of the resulting channel matrix is computed: $\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}} = \\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{R}$\nwhere $\\mathbf{Q}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{M\\times S}$ is unitary and $\\mathbf{R}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{S\\times S}$ is upper-triangular. The channel outputs are then pre-multiplied by $\\mathbf{Q}^{\\mathsf{H}}$. This leads to the final channel model on which the K-Best detection algorithm operates: $\\bar{\\mathbf{y}} = \\mathbf{R}\\bar{\\mathbf{x}} + \\bar{\\mathbf{n}}$\nwhere $\\bar{\\mathbf{y}}\\in\\mathbb{C}^S$, $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}\\in\\mathbb{C}^S$, and $\\bar{\\mathbf{n}}\\in\\mathbb{C}^S$ with $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\bar{\\mathbf{n}}\\right]=\\mathbf{0}$ and $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\bar{\\mathbf{n}}\\bar{\\mathbf{n}}^{\\mathsf{H}}\\right]=\\mathbf{I}$.\n\n**LLR Computation**\nThe K-Best algorithm produces $K$ candidate solutions $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_k\\in\\mathcal{C}^S$ and their associated distance metrics $d_k=\\lVert \\bar{\\mathbf{y}} - \\mathbf{R}\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_k \\rVert^2$ for $k=1,\\dots,K$. If the real-valued channel representation is used, the distance metrics are scaled by 0.5 to account for the reduced noise power in each complex dimension. A hard-decision is simply the candidate with the shortest distance. Various ways to compute LLRs from this list (and possibly additional side-information) are possible. The (sub-optimal) default solution is List2LLRSimple. Custom solutions can be provided.\n\n**Parameters**\n\n- `output` (str): Type of output, either \"bit\" for bits or \"symbol\" for symbols.

To visualize the constellation, use the `show` method of the `Constellation` class:\n```python\nconstellation_qpsk.show()\nconstellation_16qam.show()\n```\nThis will generate a plot of the constellation points.\n\n4. To simulate the transmission of symbols over a channel and their demapping, you can use the `Mapper` and `Demapper` classes along with a channel model (e.g., AWGN). Here is an example for 16-QAM:\n```python\n# Initialize mapper and demapper\nmapper = Mapper(constellation=constellation_16qam)\ndemapper = Demapper(\"app\", constellation=constellation_16qam)\n\n# Generate random bits, map them to symbols, and add noise\nsource = BinarySource()\nb = source([batch_size, num_bits_per_symbol])\nx = mapper(b)\ny = AWGN([x, noise_variance])\n\n# Demap the received symbols to LLRs\nllr = demapper([y, noise_variance])\n```\n\n5. To visualize the LLR distribution after demapping, you can calculate a histogram of the LLRs and plot it. This can be done for each bit-channel individually.\n\nRemember to replace `batch_size`, `num_bits_per_symbol`, and `noise_variance` with the appropriate values for your simulation."}]}

It involves tracing the path of a ray of light through the scene and simulating the interactions of the ray with the scene's objects. The ray tracing process includes the computation of ray intersections with scene primitives, such as triangles forming a mesh, and the transformations of the polarized field components at each point of interaction between a ray and a scene object.\n\nSionna RT is a ray tracing extension for radio propagation modeling built on top of Mitsuba 3 and TensorFlow. It uses Mitsuba 3 for rendering and handling scenes, and TensorFlow for computing the transformations of the polarized field components and combining the retained paths into time-varying channel impulse responses. Sionna RT is differentiable, meaning that channel impulse responses and functions thereof are differentiable with respect to most parameters of the ray tracing process, including material properties, antenna patterns, orientations, and positions.\n\nIn the context of Sionna RT, ray tracing is used to compute coverage maps and use ray-traced channels for link-level simulations instead of stochastic channel models. It can load external scene files or integrated scenes, and can visualize the scene and the propagation paths. It can also compute propagation paths between transmitters and receivers, transform paths into channel impulse responses, and apply Doppler shifts for the simulation of time evolution. The Paths object in Sionna RT contains detailed information about every found path and allows the generation of channel impulse responses and the application of Doppler shifts."}]}

Then, you'll import the necessary classes from the Sionna package, specifically `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder`, since the decoder needs to be compatible with the encoder's parameters. The following example illustrates this process, including a simple error handling mechanism for incompatible input LLRs:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom sionna.fec.ldpc.encoding import LDPC5GEncoder\nfrom sionna.fec.ldpc.decoding import LDPC5GDecoder \n\n# Parameters for the LDPC code\nk = 100  # Number of information bits\nn = 200  # Number of codeword bits\nnum_iter = 20  # Number of belief propagation (BP) iterations\n\n# Create an instance of LDPC5GEncoder\nencoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of LDPC5GDecoder compatible with the encoder parameters\ndecoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder=encoder,\n                        num_iter=num_iter,\n                        return_infobits=True)  # Return only information bits after decoding\n\n# Create random information bits as input\nu = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(1, k)).astype(np.float32)\n# Encode the bits to produce the codeword\nencoded_bits = encoder(u)\n\n# Generate log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) as an example, here by corrupting the codeword with noise\n# In practice, the LLRs are usually obtained from the demodulator\nnoise = np.random.normal(0, 1, encoded_bits.shape)\nllrs = 2 * (encoded_bits + noise)  # Simple LLR example for illustration\nllrs = tf.convert_to_tensor(llrs, dtype=tf.float32)\n\n# Try decoding and provide error handling for incompatible input LLRs\ntry:\n    # Attempt to decode the generated LLRs\n    decoded_bits = decoder(llrs)\nexcept tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:\n    print(\"Incompatible input LLRs:\", e)\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(\"Value Error:\", e)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"An unexpected error occurred during decoding:\", e)\n```\n\nIn this example, the LDPC5GDecoder is instantiated to match the encoder's parameters. The instantiation uses `return_infobits=True` to indicate that only the information bits should be returned after decoding, which is common when dealing with LDPC codes in a communication system.\n\nThe error handling is designed to catch cases where the input LLRs might not be compatible or correctly shaped, which could raise a `tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError`. Additionally, other exceptions, such as `ValueError`, are handled in a similar way to provide a clear message to the user about the nature of the problem. The overall intention is to gracefully catch errors that may occur during the decoding process, especially those related to the input LLRs.\n\nIf the LLRs were shaped differently than expected (e.g., not matching the length of `n`), the error handling block would print an error message instead of causing the program to crash. It's important that the error is accurately reported and understood for debugging purposes."}]}

It defines the encoded output block size, which impacts the transmitted signal's bandwidth and the decoder's complexity (as it relates to the length of the sequences it must process).\n\n5. `terminate`: Termination of the convolutional encoder ensures that the encoder ends in a known state, aiding the decoder in correctly interpreting the end of the transmitted codeword. For practical use, termination may introduce a slight decrease in the effective code rate since additional bits are required to bring the encoder to the terminal state, but it can substantially improve decoding performance by reducing uncertainty at the ends of code blocks.\n\n6. `trellis`: The trellis is a critical structure that represents the state transitions and output symbols (or bits) for each possible state and input bit combination in the encoder. For both Viterbi and BCJR decoding algorithms, the trellis dictates the possible paths the estimated sequence can take, and knowledge of the trellis structure is essentially required for the decoders to function properly.\n\n    ```python\n    from sionna.fec.conv.utils import Trellis\n    trellis = Trellis(gen_poly, rsc=True)\n    ```\n\nThese properties directly impact how `ConvEncoder`, `ViterbiDecoder`, and `BCJRDecoder` are instantiated and utilized. For instance, when setting up these instances, one must either pass the `gen_poly` derived from `polynomial_selector` or specify the `rate` and `constraint_length` for automatic selection:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.conv import ConvEncoder, ViterbiDecoder, BCJRDecoder\n\nencoder = ConvEncoder(gen_poly=gen_poly, terminate=True)\nviterbi_decoder = ViterbiDecoder(encoder=encoder)\nbcjr_decoder = BCJRDecoder(encoder=encoder, algorithm=\"map\")\n```\n\nThe instantiation and the set of passed parameters dictate the performance characteristics of the convolutional encoder and decoder pair. The appropriate use of encoder parameters optimizes the trade-off between error correction performance, bandwidth usage, and computational complexity in various communication scenarios."}]}

Plot the BLER values against the $E_b/N_0$ values to obtain the BLER curve. In the context, this is done with the lines:\n\n```python\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,8))\nplt.xlabel(r\"$E_b/N_0$ (dB)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"BLER\")\nplt.grid(which=\"both\")\nplt.semilogy(sim_params[\"ebno_db\"], bler)\n```\n\nThis will create a semi-logarithmic plot of the BLER values, which is the standard way to present BLER curves."}]}

Models currently available include AWGN, flat-fading with (optional) SpatialCorrelation, RayleighBlockFading, as well as models from the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) [3GPP TR 38.901, \u201cStudy on channel model for frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz\u201d, Release 16.1]: TDL, CDL, UMi, UMa, and RMa. It is also possible to [use externally generated CIRs](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.wireless.html#external-datasets).\n\nApart from [flat-fading](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.wireless.html#flat-fading), all of these models generate channel impulse responses (CIRs) that can then be used to implement a channel transfer function in the [time domain](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.wireless.html#time-domain) or [assuming an OFDM waveform](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.wireless.html#ofdm-waveform).\n\nThis is achieved using the different functions, classes, and Keras layers which operate as shown in the figures below.  \n  \n[Fig. 7 Channel module architecture for time domain simulations.](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/_images/channel_arch_time.png)  \n  \n[Fig. 8 Channel module architecture for simulations assuming OFDM waveform.](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/_images/channel_arch_freq.png)  \n  \nA channel model generate CIRs from which channel responses in the time domain or in the frequency domain are computed using the cir_to_time_channel() or cir_to_ofdm_channel() functions, respectively. If one does not need access to the raw CIRs, the GenerateTimeChannel and GenerateOFDMChannel classes can be used to conveniently sample CIRs and generate channel responses in the desired domain.\n\nOnce the channel responses in the time or frequency domain are computed, they can be applied to the channel input using the ApplyTimeChannel or ApplyOFDMChannel Keras layers.  \n  \nApplying the channel in the time domain can be done by using cir_to_time_channel() and ApplyTimeChannel instead of cir_to_ofdm_channel() and ApplyOFDMChannel, respectively.  \n  \nA channel model, such as RayleighBlockFading or UMi, is used to generate for each link between antenna $k$ of transmitter $u$ and antenna $l$ of receiver $v$ a power delay profile $(a_{u, k, v, l, m}(t), \\tau_{u, v, m}), 0 \\leq m \\leq M-1$. The delays are assumed not to depend on time $t$, and transmit and receive antennas $k$ and $l$. Such a power delay profile corresponds to the channel impulse response $h_{u, k, v, l}(t,\\tau) =\n\\sum_{m=0}^{M-1} a_{u, k, v, l,m}(t) \\delta(\\tau - \\tau_{u, v, m})$.  \n  \nwhere $\\delta(\\cdot)$ is the Dirac delta measure. For example, in the case of Rayleigh block fading, the power delay profiles are time-invariant and such that for every link $(u, k, v, l)$  \n  \n$\\begin{split}\\begin{align}\n   M                     &= 1\\\\\n   \\tau_{u, v, 0}  &= 0\\\\\n   a_{u, k, v, l, 0}     &\\sim \\mathcal{CN}(0,1).\n\\end{align}\\end{split}$  \n  \n3GPP channel models use the procedure depicted in [3GPP TR 38.901, \u201cStudy on channel model for frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz\u201d, Release 16.1] to generate power delay profiles. With these models, the power delay profiles are time-variant in the event of mobility.  \n  "}]}

This complexity means that the time required for the encoding process grows quadratically with the number of information bits $k$.\n\nIn scenarios where quick encoding is essential, such as real-time communication systems or applications with strict latency requirements, the $O(k^2)$ complexity might not be suitable, as lengthy encoding times could lead to unacceptable delays. In such cases, opting for more efficient encoders with lower complexity could be necessary. For high-speed communication systems or those with large block size codes, encoders like `Polar5GEncoder` or `LDPC5GEncoder` that provide optimized performance could be more appropriate as they are specifically designed to be more efficient with certain code types, potentially having lower complexities than $O(k^2)$.\n\nOn the other hand, in applications where encoding time is less critical, such as non-real-time data storage or transmission where latency is a lesser concern, the $O(k^2)$ complexity may be acceptable. This is especially true if the advantage of using a universal encoder, like the `LinearEncoder` from Sionna, outweighs the need for speed. The `LinearEncoder` supports any binary linear block code and can be a versatile choice for a wide range of codes without the need for code-specific optimization.\n\nIt's also worth noting that, for certain applications, the absolute value of $k$ might not be very large, in which case the $O(k^2)$ complexity may not pose a significant practical issue.\n\nFor simulation purposes or in instances where the actual encoding process is not required, using something like the `AllZeroEncoder` might be an option. This dummy encoder, which always outputs an all-zero codeword, can be useful for simulating bit error rate (BER) performance without needing to perform the real encoding operation.\n\nIn conclusion, when deciding on an encoder, it is crucial to consider the application's demands for speed and complexity against the flexibility and convenience offered by a generic `LinearEncoder`. If the application can tolerate the $O(k^2)$ complexity in favor of generality, the `LinearEncoder` could be a suitable choice. Otherwise, for applications demanding higher efficiency, encoders tailored to specific code types with potentially lower complexities should be explored. The specific selection should be made based on evaluating the trade-offs between encoding complexity, encoding time, and the constraints of the application being considered."}]}

For example, if your reflector is named \"reflector\", you would use `scene.get(\"reflector\")`.\n\n2. Once you have access to the reflector, you can change its radio material's scattering coefficient. The radio material can be accessed through the `radio_material` attribute of the reflector, and the scattering coefficient can be set using the `scattering_coefficient` attribute. For example, to set the scattering coefficient to 0.5, you would use `scene.get(\"reflector\").radio_material.scattering_coefficient = 0.5`.\n\n3. After changing the scattering coefficient, you can run the path computations again. This can be done by calling the `compute_paths` method on your scene object. You can specify the number of samples, whether to include line-of-sight paths, reflection paths, and scattering paths, and the scattering keep probability. For example, to compute paths with 1 million samples, excluding line-of-sight and reflection paths, including scattering paths, and with a scattering keep probability of 1.0, you would use `scene.compute_paths(num_samples=1e6, los=False, reflection=False, scattering=True)`.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs these steps:\n\n```python\n# Change the scattering coefficient\nscene.get(\"reflector\").radio_material.scattering_coefficient = 0.5\n\n# Run the path computations again\npaths = scene.compute_paths(num_samples=1e6, los=False, reflection=False, scattering=True)\n```\n\nPlease replace \"reflector\" with the actual name of your reflector, and adjust the parameters of the `compute_paths` method as needed for your specific use case."}]}

This approach is the most accurate but comes at the cost of high computational complexity. It is most suitable when the lengths of the considered trajectories are small, i.e., not more than a few wavelengths.\n\n2. Using Doppler Shifts: This approach is based on the experienced Doppler shifts of all propagation paths. It is very fast and leads to very accurate predictions in many cases. In order to compute the Doppler shift for a specific path, Sionna RT relies on the velocity vectors of the scene objects. The Doppler shift for a path can be computed using the `apply_doppler` method of a `Paths` object. This method is more practical for modeling the evolution of channels over very short time horizons."}]}

These are the bits that contain meaningful information before any encoding is done. For the `LDPC5GEncoder` instance we are about to create, `k` would be equal to 1000, as per the instruction.\n\n- `n` is the number of codeword bits: The `n` parameter represents the total number of bits in the codeword after encoding, which includes both the original information bits (`k`) and the additional parity bits added by the encoding process for error detection and correction purposes.

After recovering the signals, it computes the corresponding log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) or hard decisions for each bit of every stream or the constellation symbols for every stream, depending on the specified output type (\"bit\" or \"symbol\").

This method is the most accurate but comes at the cost of high computational complexity. It is most suitable when the lengths of the considered trajectories are small, i.e., not more than a few wavelengths.\n\n2. **Using Doppler Shifts**: This approach computes the time evolution of the channel impulse response based on the experienced Doppler shifts of all propagation paths. It is very fast and leads to very accurate predictions in many cases. The Doppler shift for a specific path is computed using the velocity vectors of the scene objects.\n\nIn the given context, both methods are used to simulate the impact of movement of scene objects on the channel impulse response. The first method is used to move the cars in a scene along straight lines for a couple of steps and compute a coverage map at each step. The second method is used to compute a time-varying channel impulse response and estimate its Delay-Doppler spectrum.\n\nThe comparison of the two methods shows that there is no noticeable difference between the Doppler-based channel evolution and the one based on physically moving objects until a certain time step.

It is considered the most dominant source of noise in such models. The noise power of ASE is given by the formula:\n\nP_ASE = \u03c1_ASE * f_sim = 1/2 * G * F * h * f_c * f_sim\n\nwhere G is the gain, F is the linear noise figure, f_c is the carrier frequency, and f_sim is the simulation bandwidth. The quantity \u03c1_ASE represents the noise spectral density of the EDFAs, and h is Planck's constant.\n\nIn the Sionna package, ASE noise is implemented in the optical channel model by setting up the channel with lumped amplification. This is done by creating an instance of the SSFM (Split-Step Fourier Method) layer with the `with_amplification` parameter set to `False`, and then creating an instance of the EDFA layer with the gain G and noise figure F. The channel is then simulated by passing the input signal through the SSFM layer and the EDFA layer in a loop for a specified number of spans.\n\nHere is a simplified example of how this is done in code:\n\n```python\nspan = sionna.channel.optical.SSFM(\n            alpha=alpha,\n            f_c=f_c,\n            length=length_sp,\n            sample_duration=dt,\n            with_amplification=False,\n            with_attenuation=True,\n            with_dispersion=False,\n            with_nonlinearity=False,\n            dtype=dtype,\n            t_norm=t_norm)\namplifier = sionna.channel.optical.EDFA(\n            g=g_edfa,\n            f=f_edfa,\n            f_c=f_c,\n            dt=dt * t_norm,  # t_norm is in absolute (not normalized) units\n            dtype=dtype)\ndef lumped_amplification_channel(inputs):\n    (u_0) = inputs\n    u = u_0\n    for _ in range(n_span):\n        u = span(u)\n        u = amplifier(u)\n    return u\n```\n\nIn this code, `alpha` is the fiber attenuation, `f_c` is the carrier frequency, `length_sp` is the fiber span length, `dt` is the sample duration, `g_edfa` is the amplifier gain, and `f_edfa` is the noise figure. The function `lumped_amplification_channel` simulates the transmission of the input signal over the channel."}]}

While this method is the most accurate, it is computationally complex. However, this approach is not necessary when the lengths of the considered trajectories are small, i.e., not more than a few wavelengths.\n\n2. **Using Doppler Shifts:** The second approach is based on the experienced Doppler shifts of all propagation paths. This method is very fast and leads to very accurate predictions in many cases. In order to compute the Doppler shift for a specific path, Sionna RT relies on the velocity vectors of the scene objects. The Doppler shift for a path can be computed using the `apply_doppler()` method of a `Paths` object.\n\nIn the context provided, the Sionna RT module is used to simulate the effects of mobility. The `position` and `orientation` properties are used to move scene objects, and the `velocity` property of scene objects is used to understand their impact on the Doppler shift. The `apply_doppler` method of a `Paths` object is used to compute the time evolution of the channel impulse response. \n\nThe comparison between the Doppler-based channel evolution and the one based on physically moving objects shows that there is no noticeable difference until a certain time step. After that, some paths (dis-)appear and the Doppler-based time-evolution becomes less accurate. \n\nIn summary, both approaches can be combined to simulate mobility over longer periods of time. The choice between the two methods depends on the specific requirements of the simulation, such as the accuracy needed and the computational resources available."}]}

Defaults to tf.complex64.\n\nOnce the class is initialized with proper parameters, the model can be used as a callable function which takes two regular input: a batch size and a number of time steps, to generate a batch of channel responses.\n\nThis class provides the batch_size property, for getting the size of the batch. \n\nHere is how you might utilize `CIRDataset` within your code:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.channel import CIRDataset\nfrom sionna.channel import OFDMChannel\n\n# Initialize generator\nmy_generator = MyGenerator(...)\n\n# Setup dataset\nchannel_model = CIRDataset(my_generator,\n                           batch_size,\n                           num_rx,\n                           num_rx_ant,\n                           num_tx,\n                           num_tx_ant,\n                           num_paths,\n                           num_time_steps+l_tot-1)\n\n# Use within a channel\nchannel = OFDMChannel(channel_model = channel_model,\n                      resource_grid = rg)\n```\n\nPlease replace `MyGenerator` with the name of your generator. It should return channel impulse responses `a` and `tau` when called. The symbol `rg` denotes the instance of a resource grid. \n\nNote: The code snippet is for illustration only, and might not work directly in your project depending on your specific setup. Please adjust accordingly. \n\nAlso note that the context provides no direct information regarding the `CIRDataset` class.

In order to run the tutorial notebooks on your machine, you also need JupyterLab. You can alternatively test them on Google Colab. Although not necessary, we recommend running Sionna in a Docker container.\n\n**Note:**\nSionna requires TensorFlow 2.10-2.15 and Python 3.8-3.11. We recommend Ubuntu 22.04. Earlier versions of TensorFlow may still work but are not recommended because of known, unpatched CVEs.\n\nTo run the ray tracer on CPU, LLVM is required by DrJit. Please check the [installation instructions for the LLVM backend](https://drjit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/firststeps-py.html#llvm-backend). The ray tracing preview requires a recent version of JupyterLab. You can upgrade to the latest version via pip install --upgrade ipykernel jupyterlab (requires restart of JupyterLab).\n\nWe refer to the [TensorFlow GPU support tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu?hl=zh-cn) for GPU support and the required driver setup.\n\n# Installation using pip\n\nWe recommend to do this within a virtual environment, e.g., using conda. On macOS, you need to install tensorflow-macos first.\n\n1.) Install the package\n```\npip install sionna\n```\n\n2.) Test the installation in Python\n```\npython\n```\n\n```\nimport sionna\nprint(sionna.__version__)\n0.17.0\n```\n\n3.) Once Sionna is installed, you can run the [Sionna \u201cHello, World!\u201d example](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/examples/Hello_World.html), have a look at the [quick start guide](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/quickstart.html), or at the [tutorials](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/tutorials.html).\n\nFor a local installation, the JupyterLab Desktop application can be used. This directly includes the Python installation and configuration.\n\n# Docker-based Installation\n\n1.) Make sure that you have Docker installed on your system. On Ubuntu 22.04, you can run for example\n```\nsudo apt install docker.io\n```\n\nEnsure that your user belongs to the docker group (see [Docker post-installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)).\n\n```\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n```\n\nLog out and re-login to load updated group memberships.\n\nFor GPU support on Linux, you need to install the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker).\n\n2.) Build the Sionna Docker image. From within the Sionna directory, run:\n```\nmake docker\n```\n\n3.) Run the Docker image with GPU support\n```\nmake run-docker gpus=all\n```\nor without GPU:\n```\nmake run-docker\n```\n\nThis will immediately launch a Docker image with Sionna installed, running JupyterLab on port 8888.\n\n4.) Browse through the example notebook by connecting to http://127.0.0.1:8888 in your browser.\n\n# Installation from source\n\nWe recommend to do this within a virtual environment, e.g., using conda.\n\n1.)

The CIR includes the path gains and delays for each path between the UT and BS antennas.\n\n4. Convert the CIR to the frequency domain: This step involves computing the Fourier transform of the CIR at the subcarrier frequencies. The result is the channel frequency response (CFR), which describes the channel's effect on each subcarrier.\n\n5. Simulate the transmission: This involves encoding and modulating the data, mapping the data onto the OFDM resource grid, applying the CFR to the transmitted signal, and adding noise. The received signal is then demodulated and decoded to recover the transmitted data.\n\n6. Evaluate the performance: The performance of the uplink transmission can be evaluated in terms of the bit error rate (BER) or block error rate (BLER). These metrics can be computed by comparing the transmitted and received data.\n\n7. Repeat the simulation for different mobility scenarios: By repeating the simulation for different UT speeds, you can evaluate how the uplink performance is affected by mobility.\n\nNote: The simulation can be performed in either the time domain or the frequency domain. Time-domain simulations can capture more realistic effects, such as inter-symbol interference due to insufficient cyclic prefix length.

The EDFA class amplifies the optical input signal by a given gain and adds amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise. It also allows configuration for specific technical variables, such as amplifier gain, noise figure, and carrier frequency.\n\nThe usage of the class is generally as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.channel import EDFA\n\nedfa = EDFA(\n    g=4.0,   # Amplifier gain (linear domain)\n    f=2.0,   # Noise figure (linear domain)\n    f_c=193.55e12,    # Carrier frequency in Hz\n    dt=1.0e-12,   # Time step in seconds\n    with_dual_polarization=False   # Considers axis [-2] as x- and y-polarization and applies the noise per polarization\n)\n```\n\nThe EDFA instance (in this case `edfa`) can then be used as a callable in your communication system model. For example, the amplified output signal `y` can be obtained from an input optical signal `x` as:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Number of samples in the signal\nnum_samples = 1024\n\n# Generate a random complex signal as input\n# Assume the amplitude of the signal is in sqrt(W)\nreal_part = np.random.normal(size=num_samples).astype(np.float32)\nimag_part = np.random.normal(size=num_samples).astype(np.float32)\nx = tf.complex(real_part, imag_part)\n\n# Amplify the signal using the EDFA\ny = edfa(x)\n\n# Print or further process the output signal\nprint(\"Output signal shape:\", y.shape)\n```\n\nIn terms of its properties, this class has parameters such as amplifier gain `g`, noise figure `f`, carrier frequency `f_c`, time step `dt`, and an option to consider dual polarization. Note that the input signal `x` can be a tensor of type `tf.complex`, and the output signal `y` will also be a tensor of the same shape as `x`, but the data type as specified in the constructor (which defaults to `tf.complex64`).\n\nIt's important to note that this class inherits from the Keras `Layer` class, so it can be used as a layer in a Keras model.\n\nThis explanation assumes that you have a basic understanding of optical communication systems and the particular role an Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier plays in such a model."}]}

This feature simplifies distributed graph execution by making seeding and reseeding unnecessary during runtime.\n\nThere are three types of interleavers implemented in this fashion:\n\n1. **RandomInterleaver**: This interleaver permutes tensors through pseudo-random permutations. While the internal seed is fixed and does not change after initialization, an explicit random seed can be passed as additional input when calling the layer if required.\n\n2. **RowColumnInterleaver**: This interleaver reshuffles a sequence of inputs through row/column swapping. It does not involve a seed for randomization, making it stateless by nature.\n\n3. **Turbo3GPPInterleaver**: This interleaver, used in 3GPP Turbo codes, up to a maximum length of 6144 elements along the shuffled dimension. It does not require an internal state.\n\nThe Deinterleaver is closely related and is used to reverse the operation of the interleaver. It receives an Interleaver instance as an argument during initialization and keeps no state of its own.\n\nHere is a Python example of how to use these utility classes:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.interleaving import RandomInterleaver\nfrom sionna.fec.interleaving import Deinterleaver\nimport tensorflow as tf\n# set-up system\ninterleaver = RandomInterleaver(seed=1234,# an explicit seed can be provided\n                                keep_batch_constant=False, # if True, all samples in the batch are permuted with the same pattern\n                                axis=-1) # axis which shall be permuted\n\ndeinterleaver = Deinterleaver(interleaver=interleaver) # connect interleaver and deinterleaver\n\n# permute a tensor, c with arbitrary shape (rank>=2), choose your own c\nc = tf.constant([\n    [[1, 2, 3, 4],\n     [5, 6, 7, 8],\n     [9, 10, 11, 12]],\n    [[13, 14, 15, 16],\n     [17, 18, 19, 20],\n     [21, 22, 23, 24]]\n])\nc_int = interleaver(c)\n\n# call deinterleaver to reconstruct the original order\nc_deint = deinterleaver(c_int)\n```\nRemember to import the appropriate layers from sionna.fec.interleaving.

The Kerr nonlinearity applies a phase shift to the transmitted signal depending on its instantaneous power, while the chromatic dispersion causes the received impulse to significantly broaden in time. \n\nHowever, when these effects are applied jointly, the Gaussian input impulse is transformed to a higher-order Soliton during propagation. Solitons are self-reinforcing solitary wave packets that maintain their shape while propagating at a constant velocity, and they require a joint CD and Kerr nonlinearity to exist. This transformation results in the compression of the spectrum of the received signal, which is contrary to the expected Kerr nonlinearity-induced spectral broadening. \n\nThis observation highlights the complex interplay of the different impairments introduced during signal propagation in optical fibers, and how their joint application can lead to unexpected results."}]}

Also, define the gradient clipping value to ensure stable training convergence.\n\n4. Define the optimizer: Use the `tf.keras.optimizers.Adam` optimizer with a specified learning rate.\n\n5. Start the training loop: For each training iteration, perform the following steps:\n   - Use `tf.GradientTape` to record the operations for automatic differentiation.\n   - Call the model with the batch size and Eb/No value to get the output and loss.\n   - Compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the model's trainable variables using the `tape.gradient` method.\n   - Clip the gradients to the specified range using `tf.clip_by_value`.\n   - Apply the gradients to the model's trainable weights using the `optimizer.apply_gradients` method.\n\n6. Evaluate the model: After every few training iterations, compute and print the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss, Bit Error Rate (BER), and Bitwise Mutual Information (BMI) to monitor the training progress.\n\nRemember to ensure that the decoder is set to be trainable (`trainable=True`) so that its weights can be updated during the training.

For a single pair of antennas, the received signal sequence is given as: $y_b = \\sum_{\\ell =L_\\text{min}}^{L_\\text{max}} \\bar{h}_\\ell x_{b-\\ell} + w_b, \\quad b \\in[L_\\text{min}, N_B+L_\\text{max}-1]$ where $\\bar{h}_\\ell$ are the discrete-time channel taps, $x_{b}$ is the the transmitted signal, and $w_\\ell$ Gaussian noise.\n\nStarting from the first symbol, the demodulator cuts the input sequence into pieces of size cyclic_prefix_length + fft_size, and throws away any trailing symbols. For each piece, the cyclic prefix is removed and the fft_size-point discrete Fourier transform is computed.\n\nSince the input sequence starts at time $L_\\text{min}$, the FFT-window has a timing offset of $L_\\text{min}$ symbols, which leads to a subcarrier-dependent phase shift of $e^{\\frac{j2\\pi k L_\\text{min}}{N}}$, where $k$ is the subcarrier index, $N$ is the FFT size, and $L_\\text{min} \\le 0$ is the largest negative time lag of the discrete-time channel impulse response. This phase shift is removed in this layer, by explicitly multiplying each subcarrier by $e^{\\frac{-j2\\pi k L_\\text{min}}{N}}$. This is a very important step to enable channel estimation with sparse pilot patterns that needs to interpolate the channel frequency response accross subcarriers. It also ensures that the channel frequency response seen by the time-domain channel is close to the OFDMChannel.\n\n**Parameters**\n\n- `fft_size` (int): FFT size, i.e., the number of subcarriers.\n- `l_min` (int): The largest negative time lag of the discrete-time channel impulse response. It should be the same value as that used by the `cir_to_time_channel` function.\n- `cyclic_prefix_length` (int): Integer indicating the length of the cyclic prefix that is prepended to each OFDM symbol.\n\n**Input**\n\n- `[..., num_ofdm_symbols*(fft_size + cyclic_prefix_length) + n]`, tf.complex: Tensor containing the time-domain signal along the last dimension. `n` is a nonnegative integer.\n\n**Output**\n\n- `[..., num_ofdm_symbols, fft_size]`, tf.complex: Tensor containing the OFDM resource grid along the last two dimensions."}]}

Therefore, a natural choice for the loss function is the binary cross-entropy (BCE) applied to each bit and to each received symbol. In TensorFlow, this can be defined as follows:\n\n```python\nbce = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True)\n```\n\n2. **Perform a Forward Pass Through the End-to-End System and Compute the Loss Function**: This is done within a `GradientTape` to enable gradient computation. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nwith tf.GradientTape() as tape:\n    bits = binary_source([BATCH_SIZE, 1200]) # Blocklength\n    x = mapper(bits)\n    y = awgn_channel([x, no])\n    llr = demapper([y,no])\n    loss = bce(bits, llr)\n```\n\n3. **Compute the Gradient of the Loss Function with Respect to the Trainable Weights**: This is done using the `GradientTape`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ngradient = tape.gradient(loss, tape.watched_variables())\n```\n\n4. **Apply the Gradient to the Weights**: This is performed using an optimizer. Many optimizers are available as part of TensorFlow, and in this case, we use `Adam`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\noptimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(1e-2)\noptimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradient, tape.watched_variables()));\n```\n\n5. **Iterate Over SGD Steps Until a Stop Criterion is Met**: Training of a communication system using SGD consists in looping over such SGD steps until a stop criterion is met. This can be done in a loop where you perform the forward pass, compute the gradient, and apply the gradient to the weights.\n\nRemember, the constellation is set to be trainable when instantiating the `Constellation` object in Sionna:\n\n```python\nconstellation = sn.mapping.Constellation(\"qam\", NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL, trainable=True)\n```\n\nThis is a high-level overview of how to optimize the constellation through SGD.

In the context of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) decoders, such as a belief propagation decoder, it is desirable to have a sparse parity-check matrix. A dense matrix can lead to a high density of short cycles in the corresponding Tanner graph, which can significantly degrade the performance of belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithms and increase the computational complexity.\n\n2. **Presence of Short Cycles**: Due to the dense nature of the matrix, the graph has many short cycles. This is not beneficial for BP decoding, as the presence of abundant short cycles can cause the decoding process to converge slowly or to incorrect solutions, resulting in poor error-correction performance.\n\n3. **Suboptimal for Belief Propagation Decoding**: Although the `generate_dense_polar` documentation suggests that the generated parity-check matrix can be used with the `LDPCBPDecoder` class, it is advisable to avoid belief propagation decoding with such a dense matrix. It is because the LDPC decoding assumption of sparsity and minimal cycles doesn't hold, which leads to a suboptimal performance for LDPC decoders.\n\nRecommended uses of parity-check matrices generated by `generate_dense_polar` function:\n\n1. **Initial Understanding and Educational Purposes**: This dense parity-check representation can be beneficial for educational purposes. It offers an excellent opportunity to study the properties of Polar codes and understand the connection between encoding and decoding processes.\n\n2. **Exploratory Research**: Researchers investigating new algorithms for Polar code decoding might use dense parity-check matrices to benchmark and contrast the performance of novel decoding strategies against traditional belief propagation methods.\n\n3. **Polar Code Design Analysis**: Dense parity-check matrices may be helpful in analyzing specific Polar code designs, particularly in the context of linear and affine properties of code constructions.\n\nIn higher-performance scenarios, decoders such as Successive Cancellation (SC), Successive Cancellation List (SCL), or even dedicated Polar BP decoders (designed with the structure of Polar codes in mind) are more appropriate choices. These are not only more aligned with the characteristics of Polar codes but also ensure better decoding performance. For practical uses and implementations that target high throughput and efficiency, opting for these algorithm-specific decoders over general BP decoding with a dense parity-check matrix from `generate_dense_polar` is strongly recommended."}]}

In the time domain, the signal or function's value is known for all real numbers, for the case of continuous time, or at various separate instants in the case of discrete time.\n\nOFDM stands for Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing. In the context provided, an OFDM waveform is a method of encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies. OFDM has developed into a popular scheme for wideband digital communication, used in applications such as digital television and audio broadcasting, DSL internet access, wireless networks, powerline networks, and 4G/5G mobile communications.\n\nThe \"Channel module\" describes a system to implement wireless channel models. These can generate channel impulse responses (CIRs) in time domain or follow an OFDM waveform. The architecture for time domain simulations and OFDM waveform simulations are presented in figures 7 and 8 respectively in the provided context. \n\nThe behavior of the channel module is governed by different functions, classes, and Keras layers which are used to compute the channel responses (either in the time or frequency domain), generate channel model and apply it to channel input. The transfer function in time domain can be implemented using [`cir_to_time_channel()`](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.wireless.html#sionna.channel.cir_to_time_channel), whereas assuming an OFDM waveform, [`cir_to_ofdm_channel()`](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.wireless.html#sionna.channel.cir_to_ofdm_channel) function can be used.

These devices are responsible for sending and receiving signals that carry the data being transmitted. Antennas are a core component of these transmitters and receivers as they are the interface between the transmitter and the external environment, and likewise for the receivers.\n\nThe use of transmitters and receivers fitted with an AntennaArray instead of a single Antenna is referenced in the context. An AntennaArray, as its name suggests, is an array of antennas. This multi-antenna system significantly enhances the performance of the communication system as compared to a single-antenna system.\n\nTogether, the Antennas in an AntennaArray work coherently to more accurately capture the signal that a single Antenna might miss. This is primarily because of the spatial diversity that an AntennaArray provides. The signal, instead of being received at a single point (in the case of a single Antenna), it is received at multiple points (in each Antenna in the AntennaArray). This offers multiple pathways for the signal to reach the receiver which reduces the effect of fading and hence improves the quality of signal reception.\n\nAdditionally, AntennaArrays allow for signal processing techniques that improve the system's performance. These techniques include beamforming and spatial filtering which enhance the signal quality and reception. Beamforming focuses the signal energy in a specific direction, thereby substantially reducing interference from other directions.\n\nIn the Sionna module, AntennaArray is used and configured in the Transmitters and Receivers. All transmitters in a Scene share the same AntennaArray, which can be set through the Scene property tx_array. Similarly, all receivers share an AntennaArray which can be defined through the Scene's rx_array property.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of an AntennaArray in Transmitters and Receivers in place of a single Antenna significantly improves the performance of the wireless communication system, particularly in terms of better signal reception, interference reduction and improved signal quality."}]}

Before detailing these steps, it's important to note that Ordered-Statistics Decoding is an advanced error-correcting code decoding technique for linear block codes that can closely approximate maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding performance for an appropriately chosen order of decoding `t`.\n\nHere are the steps of the OSD algorithm:\n\n1. Sort the channel log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) according to their reliability. This step aims to identify which positions in the received vector are most likely to be correct. Concurrently, apply the same permutation to the columns of the generator matrix to maintain the correspondence between the LLRs and the columns of the code's matrix representation.\n\n2. Transform the permuted generator matrix into its systematic form, often referred to as the *most-reliable basis*. This means modifying the matrix so that the left side becomes an identity matrix, which simplifies further processing.\n\n3. Hard-decide (i.e, make a binary decision based on the sign of the LLR) the `k` most reliable bits, which correspond to the positions that were identified as most reliable in step 1, and then re-encode these bits. The remaining `n-k` positions of the received vector that are deemed less reliable are discarded.\n\n4. Generate all possible error patterns that can occur up to `t` errors among these `k` most reliable bits and find the most likely codeword within these candidates. The likelihood of each candidate codeword is evaluated, and the most probable codeword is selected as the output.\n\nFor implementation purposes, the `OSDecoder` class in Sionna can be used to instantiate an OSD object for a given linear block code, which can be set up as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.linear import OSDecoder\n\n# Assuming pcm is a previously loaded parity-check matrix\ndecoder = OSDecoder(pcm, t=4, is_pcm=True)  # t is the OSD order\n```\n\nThen, the decoding process occurs by calling the decoder with the received LLRs:\n\n```python\n# Assuming llr_ch is a tensor containing channel LLRs\nc_hat = decoder(llr_ch)\n```\n\nIn `c_hat`, we will have the binary hard-decisions for all codeword bits following the OSD algorithm.\n\nKeep in mind that the computational complexity of OSD can be substantially high, especially for long codes or large orders `t`. Therefore, OSD is practical for moderate-length codes or when `t` is relatively small. For larger codes or instances where computational efficiency is paramount, other decoding algorithms may be more appropriate. \n\nLastly, the note that using the decoder in XLA mode can significantly reduce the memory complexity may suggest that for practical applications where the memory footprint is critical, enabling XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) could provide performance benefits."}]}

These standards, established by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), define LDPC as one of the channel coding schemes used for data transmission in 5G networks.\n\nThe encoder class is integral to the process of encoding data for error correction before transmission over a noisy communication channel. It takes a predefined number of information bits (k) as input and encodes them into a larger set of codeword bits (n), thus adding redundancy that can be exploited by the receiver's decoder to correct errors induced by the channel.\n\nThe `LDPC5GEncoder` class in Sionna specifically supports rate-matching for 5G, which includes puncturing (removing certain bits from the codeword) and shortening (adding extra zero bits before encoding). These processes allow the encoded codeword's length to be adjusted to fit various transmission bandwidths and frame structures as defined by the 5G standard.\n\nHere's an illustrative Python snippet from the given context that shows how to create an instance of `LDPC5GEncoder`:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.ldpc.encoding import LDPC5GEncoder\n\nencoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k=100, # number of information bits\n                        n=200) # number of codeword bits\n```\n\nIn this example, `k=100` and `n=200` specify the encoder to create a codeword of length 200 bits from 100 information bits. The encoded output can then be modulated and transmitted over a 5G communication channel.\n\nTo ensure that the encoded data can be correctly recovered at the receiver, the `LDPC5GEncoder` works in conjunction with a compatible decoder, such as `LDPC5GDecoder`. This decoder is designed to reverse the encoding process, including compensating for puncturing and shortening.\n\nHere's an illustrative snippet showing the corresponding decoder setup:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.ldpc.decoding import LDPC5GDecoder\n\ndecoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder=encoder,   # Encoder instance\n                        num_iter=20,       # Number of BP iterations\n                        return_infobits=True)\n```\n\nIn this context, `encoder=encoder` specifies that the decoder should be compatible with the provided encoder instance. The `num_iter=20` parameter sets the number of belief propagation iterations for decoding, and `return_infobits=True` indicates that only the information bits (as opposed to the entire codeword) should be returned after decoding.\n\nTo summarize, the `LDPC5GEncoder` class in the Sionna package provides a way to encode data using LDPC codes according to the 5G NR standards, and is paired with a `LDPC5GDecoder` class to ensure that the transmitted data can be accurately decoded and recovered. They are crucial components in the physical layer of 5G wireless communication systems for maintaining data integrity and reliability."}]}

This channel can then be used for various link-level simulations including, for example, evaluating the performance of different modulation schemes, error correction codes, or equalization techniques under specific propagation conditions modeled by the ray tracer.\n\nThe 'cir_to_ofdm_channel()' function also serves a similar purpose but for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) link-level simulations. In OFDM systems, the frequency-selective channel is divided into several flat-fading sub-channels. This function converts the CIRs into the frequency response representation required for OFDM simulations.\n\nAs for their implementation details, based on the provided context, it can't be determined.

The Doppler shift `f_\u0394` for this path can be computed using the formula provided in the Sionna RT documentation.\n\nThe `velocity` property of scene objects, therefore, plays a crucial role in simulating the impact of movement of scene objects on the channel impulse response. By adjusting this property, you can simulate different mobility scenarios and study their effects on the propagation paths and the channel impulse response."}]}

It is assumed that prior information of the transmitted signal $\\mathbf{x}$ is available, provided either as LLRs on the bits modulated onto $\\mathbf{x}$ or as logits on the individual constellation points forming $\\mathbf{x}$.\n\nPrior to demapping, the received signal is whitened:\n$\\begin{split}\\tilde{\\mathbf{y}} &= \\mathbf{S}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\mathbf{y}\\\\\n&=  \\mathbf{S}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{S}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\mathbf{n}\\\\\n&= \\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}\\mathbf{x} + \\tilde{\\mathbf{n}}\\end{split}$\n\nThe layer can compute ML detection of symbols or bits with either soft- or hard-decisions. Note that decisions are computed symbol-/bit-wise and not jointly for the entire vector $\\textbf{x}$ (or the underlying vector of bits).\n\n**ML detection of bits:**\nSoft-decisions on bits are called log-likelihood ratios (LLR). With the \u201capp\u201d demapping method, the LLR for the $i\\text{th}$ bit of the $k\\text{th}$ user is then computed according to $\\begin{split}\\begin{align}\n    LLR(k,i)&= \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Pr\\left(b_{k,i}=1\\lvert \\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{H}\\right)}{\\Pr\\left(b_{k,i}=0\\lvert \\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{H}\\right)}\\right)\\\\\n            &=\\ln\\left(\\frac{\n            \\sum_{\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{C}_{k,i,1}} \\exp\\left(\n                -\\left\\lVert\\tilde{\\mathbf{y}}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}\\mathbf{x}\\right\\rVert^2\n                \\right) \\Pr\\left( \\mathbf{x} \\right)\n            }{\n            \\sum_{\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{C}_{k,i,0}} \\exp\\left(\n                -\\left\\lVert\\tilde{\\mathbf{y}}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}\\mathbf{x}\\right\\rVert^2\n                \\right) \\Pr\\left( \\mathbf{x} \\right)\n            }\\right)\n\\end{align}\\end{split}$\nwhere $\\mathcal{C}_{k,i,1}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{k,i,0}$ are the sets of vectors of constellation points for which the $i\\text{th}$ bit of the $k\\text{th}$ user is equal to 1 and 0, respectively. $\\Pr\\left( \\mathbf{x} \\right)$ is the prior distribution of the vector of constellation points $\\mathbf{x}$. Assuming that the constellation points and bit levels are independent, it is computed from the prior of the bits according to \n$\\Pr\\left( \\mathbf{x} \\right) = \\prod_{k=1}^K \\prod_{i=1}^{I} \\sigma \\left( LLR_p(k,i) \\right)$\nwhere $LLR_p(k,i)$ is the prior knowledge of the $i\\text{th}$ bit of the $k\\text{th}$ user given as an LLR, and $\\sigma\\left(\\cdot\\right)$ is the sigmoid function. The definition of the LLR has been chosen such that it is equivalent with that of logit. This is different from many textbooks in communications, where the LLR is defined as $LLR(k,i) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Pr\\left(b_{k,i}=0\\lvert \\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{H}\\right)}{\\Pr\\left(b_{k,i}=1\\lvert \\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{H}\\right)}\\right)$.\n\nWith the \u201cmaxlog\u201d demapping method, the LLR for the $i\\text{th}$ bit of the $k\\text{th}$ user is approximated like\n$\\begin{split}\\begin{align}\n    LLR(k,i) \\approx&\\ln\\left(\\frac{\n        \\max_{\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{C}_{k,i,1}} \\left( \\exp\\left(\n            -\\left\\lVert\\tilde{\\mathbf{y}}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}\\mathbf{x}\\right\\rVert^2\n            \\right) \\Pr\\left( \\mathbf{x} \\right) \\right)\n        }{\n        \\max_{\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{C}_{k,i,0}} \\left( \\exp\\left(\n            -\\left\\lVert\\tilde{\\mathbf{y}}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}\\mathbf{x}\\right\\rVert^2\n            \\right) \\Pr\\left( \\mathbf{x} \\right) \\right)\n        }\\right)\\\\\n        = &\\min_{\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{C}_{k,i,0}} \\left( \\left\\lVert\\tilde{\\mathbf{y}}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}\\mathbf{x}\\right\\rVert^2 - \\ln \\left(\\Pr\\left( \\mathbf{x} \\right) \\right) \\right) -\n            \\min_{\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{C}_{k,i,1}} \\left( \\left\\lVert\\tilde{\\mathbf{y}}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}\\mathbf{x}\\right\\rVert^2 - \\ln \\left( \\Pr\\left( \\mathbf{x} \\right) \\right) \\right).\n    \\end{align}\\end{split}$\n**ML detection of symbols:**\nSoft-decisions on symbols are called logits (i.e., unnormalized log-probability).\n\nWith the \u201capp\u201d demapping method, the logit for the constellation point $c \\in \\mathcal{C}$ of the $k\\text{th}$ user is computed according to $\\begin{align}\n    \\text{logit}(k,c) &= \\ln\\left(\\sum_{\\mathbf{x} : x_k = c} \\exp\\left(\n                -\\left\\lVert\\tilde{\\mathbf{y}}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}\\mathbf{x}\\right\\rVert^2\n                \\right)\\Pr\\left( \\mathbf{x} \\right)\\right).\n\\end{align}$\n\nWith the \u201cmaxlog\u201d demapping method, the logit for the constellation point $c \\in \\mathcal{C}$ of the $k\\text{th}$ user is approximated like $\\text{logit}(k,c) \\approx \\max_{\\mathbf{x} : x_k = c} \\left(\n        -\\left\\lVert\\tilde{\\mathbf{y}}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}\\mathbf{x}\\right\\rVert^2 + \\ln \\left( \\Pr\\left( \\mathbf{x} \\right) \\right)\n        \\right).$\n\nWhen hard decisions are requested, this layer returns for the $k$th stream\n$\\hat{c}_k = \\underset{c \\in \\mathcal{C}}{\\text{argmax}} \\left( \\sum_{\\mathbf{x} : x_k = c} \\exp\\left(\n                -\\left\\lVert\\tilde{\\mathbf{y}}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}\\mathbf{x}\\right\\rVert^2\n                \\right)\\Pr\\left( \\mathbf{x} \\right) \\right)$\nwhere $\\mathcal{C}$ is the set of constellation points.\n\n**Parameters**\n\n- `output` (str): Specifies the type of output, options are \"bit\" for LLRs on bits or \"symbol\" for logits on constellation symbols.\n- `demapping_method` (str): Demapping method used, choices are \"app\" or \"maxlog\".\n- `num_streams` (tf.int): Number of transmitted streams.\n- `constellation_type` (str): Type of constellation, options are \"qam\", \"pam\", or \"custom\".

Here are the steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries:\n```python\nimport os\nimport tensorflow as tf\n```\n\n2. Set the GPU number you want to use. If you want to use the CPU, set the `gpu_num` to an empty string `\"\"`.\n```python\ngpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\nos.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n```\n\n3. Configure TensorFlow to use only a single GPU and allocate only as much memory as needed. This is done using the `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` method, which attempts to allocate only as much GPU memory as needed for the runtime allocations.\n```python\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n```\nIn the code above, `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` is used to get the list of all available GPU devices. If there are GPUs available, `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)` is used to enable memory growth for the first GPU. This command needs to be called before any GPUs have been initialized. It will raise a `RuntimeError` if that is not the case.\n\n4. To avoid warnings from TensorFlow, you can set the log level to 'ERROR'.\n```python\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\n5. Finally, to ensure reproducibility in the results, you can set a global random seed.\n```python\ntf.random.set_seed(1) # Set global random seed for reproducibility\n```\n\nPlease note that the GPU settings will only take effect if your machine has a GPU installed and the necessary drivers are correctly installed. If not, TensorFlow will automatically use a CPU."}]}

Load the scene using the `load_scene` function from the `sionna.rt` module. You can use a pre-made scene or create your own.\n\n2. Set the frequency for the scene.\n\n3. Configure the antenna arrays used by the transmitters and receivers using the `PlanarArray` function.\n\n4. Add a transmitter to the scene using the `Transmitter` function.\n\n5. Compute the coverage map using the `coverage_map` function. You need to specify the cell size for the coverage map and the number of samples to use for the computation. You can also choose to enable diffraction.\n\n6. Render the scene using the `render` function. You can specify a camera to use for the rendering and overlay the coverage map on the scene.\n\nHere is an example of how to do this:\n\n```python\n# Load the scene\nscene = load_scene(sionna.rt.scene.simple_street_canyon)\n\n# Set the carrier frequency to 1GHz\nscene.frequency = 1e9\n\n# Configure the antenna arrays used by the transmitters and receivers\nscene.tx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=1, num_cols=1, vertical_spacing=0.5, horizontal_spacing=0.5, pattern=\"iso\", polarization=\"V\")\nscene.rx_array = scene.tx_array\n\n# Add a transmitter\nscene.add(Transmitter(name=\"tx\", position=[-33,11,32], orientation=[0,0,0]))\n\n# Compute the coverage map\ncm = scene.coverage_map(cm_cell_size=[1,1], num_samples=10e6)\n\n# Add a camera looking at the scene from the top\nmy_cam = Camera(\"my_cam\", position=[10,0,300], look_at=[0,0,0])\nscene.add(my_cam)\n\n# Render the scene with the new camera and overlay the coverage map\nscene.render(my_cam, coverage_map=cm)\n```\n\nThis will create a visualization of the coverage map in the scene.

Alternatively, it can be a callable, or a sequence of two callables defining antenna patterns. If two callables are supplied, the antenna is dual polarized and each callable defines the antenna pattern in one of the two orthogonal polarization directions.\n\n- polarization: Indicates the type of polarization.

Further, interleaving\n    and scrambling is applied before a codeword concatenation generates the\n    final bit sequence. Fig. 1 provides an overview of the TB encoding\n    procedure and we refer the interested reader to [3GPP38214]_ and\n    [3GPP38211]_ for further details.\n\n    ..  figure:: ../figures/tb_encoding.png\n\n        Fig. 1: Overview TB encoding (CB CRC does not always apply).\n\n    If ``n_rnti`` and ``n_id`` are given as list, the TBEncoder encodes\n    `num_tx = len(` ``n_rnti`` `)` parallel input streams with different\n    scrambling sequences per user.\n\n    The class inherits from the Keras layer class and can be used as layer in a\n    Keras model.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n        target_tb_size: int\n            Target transport block size, i.e., how many information bits are\n            encoded into the TB.

Your proficiency in Sionna allows you to simulate and analyze various aspects of wireless communication systems effectively."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the purpose and usage of the \"Optical\" module in Sionna."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Optical\" module in Sionna is used for implementing channel models for (fiber) optical communications. It contains layers and functions that simulate the behavior of fiber optic communication channels.\n\nThe module currently supports a model known as the split-step Fourier method (`SSFM`), which can be used for both dual- and single-polarization optical signals. This method can be combined with an Erbium-doped amplifier model (`EDFA`), which represents a type of amplifier used in fiber optic communications. \n\nHere's a quick overview of how to use the module:\n\n1. Initialize the `SSFM` model with the necessary parameters including the attenuation coefficient, group velocity dispersion parameter, carrier frequency, and other optical properties. \n\n2. Then, initialize the `EDFA` model with the necessary amplifier parameters such as gain and noise figure.\n\nPython Sample Code:\n\n```python\nimport sionna\nimport tensorflow as tf\n# initialize SSFM\nspan = sionna.channel.optical.SSFM(\n                              alpha=0.046,\n                              beta_2=-21.67,\n                              f_c=193.55e12,\n                              gamma=1.27,\n                              length=80,\n                              n_ssfm=200,\n                              n_sp=1.0,\n                              t_norm=1e-12,\n                              with_amplification=False,\n                              with_attenuation=True,\n                              with_dispersion=True,\n                              with_nonlinearity=True,\n                              dtype=tf.complex64)\n\n# initialize EDFA\namplifier = sionna.channel.optical.EDFA(\n                              g=4.0,\n                              f=2.0,\n                              f_c=193.55e12,\n                              dt=1.0e-12)\n```\n\n3. Define a simulation function that applies the SSFM model and then the EDFA model for a specified number of spans (distance units). You can then use this function to simulate the transmission of an optical signal.\n\nPython Sample Code:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Number of symbols and samples per symbol\nnum_symbols = 1024\nsamples_per_symbol = 16\n\n# Generate a random complex signal as input\n# Ensuring that the dtype matches the expected type by the simulation components\nreal_part = np.random.normal(size=(num_symbols, samples_per_symbol)).astype(np.float32)\nimag_part = np.random.normal(size=(num_symbols, samples_per_symbol)).astype(np.float32)\nx = tf.complex(real_part, imag_part)\n\n# Ensure the complex tensor is in tf.complex64 if required by SSFM and EDFA\nx = tf.cast(x, dtype=tf.complex64)\n\n# Number of spans the signal will pass through\nn_span = 10\n@tf.function\ndef simulate_transmission(x, n_span):\n    y = x\n    for _ in range(n_span):\n        y = span(y)\n        y = amplifier(y)\n    return y\n\n# x is the optical input signal, n_span the number of spans\ny = simulate_transmission(x, n_span)\n```\n\nThe module also provides a slew of utility functions, such as the `time_frequency_vector` function in the `sionna.channel.utils` submodule, which is used to compute the time and frequency vector for a given number of samples and duration per sample in normalized time unit.\n\nKeep in mind that the specific parameters used depend on the exact requirements of your fiber optic channel simulation. For more in-depth usage and parameter explanations, you can review the 'Optical Channel with Lumped Amplification' tutorial included in the Sionna documentation."}]}

A Scrambler is used to randomly flip bits in a binary sequence, while a Descrambler is used to carry out the corresponding descrambling operation. \n\nTo make them work together, first create an instance of Scrambler, providing the parameters as necessary.

These parameters include:\n   \n   * `mc_fun`: A callable that yields the transmitted bits `b` and the receivers estimate `b_hat` for a given `batch_size` and `ebno_db`.\n   * `ebno_dbs`: A tensor array containing SNR points to be evaluated.\n   * `batch_size`: The batch size for evaluation.\n   * `max_mc_iter`: Maximum number of Monte-Carlo iterations per SNR point.\n   * Other optional parameters such as `soft_estimates`, `num_target_bit_errors`, `num_target_block_errors`, `target_ber`, `target_bler`, `early_stop`, most of which control the behavior of the simulation.\n\n3. **Invoking the Function**\n   With the parameters set up, call the `sim_ber` function as shown:\n   ```python\n   ber, bler = sim_ber(mc_fun, ebno_dbs, batch_size, max_mc_iter, ...)\n   ```\n\n4. **Interpreting the Output**\n   The function returns a tuple `(ber, bler)`:\n\n   * `ber` (*tf.float32*): This is the calculated bit-error rate.\n   * `bler` (*tf.float32*): This is the calculated block-error rate.\n   \nFor instance, if you measure SNR points at 3 dB, 6dB, and 9dB using a batch size of 1000 and a limit of 10000 Monte-Carlo iterations for simulation, the bit error rate (ber) and block error rate (bler) for these points can be determined which further helps in analyzing the performance of your model. \n\nPlease note: The accuracy of these rates depends on the volume and quality of data, as well as the `mc_fun` you are using. If you want the simulation to stop early, set `early_stop` to `True`, and specify either a target bit error rate (`target_ber`) or a target block error rate (`target_bler`).\n\nCAUTION: The callable `mc_fun` needs to have a explicit signature as required by the function. If it is not correct, the function may not run properly. Confirm that `mc_fun` yields the transmitted bits `b` and the receivers estimate `b_hat` for a given `batch_size` and `ebno_db`.

The parity-check matrix must be a binary matrix of full rank.\n\nHere's how you might do it, following the guidelines from the context you provided:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.linear import OSDecoder\n\n# Assume `pcm` is your predefined parity-check matrix and `t` is your desired order.\n# You should replace `pcm` with your actual parity-check matrix and `t` with the actual integer representing the order you wish to set for the decoder.\n\n# Initialize the OSDecoder with a parity-check matrix and order 't'\ndecoder = OSDecoder(pcm, t=t, is_pcm=True)\n```\n\nRemember to set `is_pcm=True` to indicate that the matrix being passed is a parity-check matrix, not a generator matrix. The variable `pcm` represents the parity-check matrix you wish to use, and you should replace `t` with the desired order for your decoder.\n\nPlease note that in the actual code, you should define the parity-check matrix `pcm` with actual values before using it to initialize the `OSDecoder`. The choice of `t` will depend on the desired complexity and performance of the decoding process, as higher orders of `t` generally lead to better performance but increased complexity."}]}

A channel impulse response (CIR) is generated using a given channel model. A CIR typically comprises of delay profiles and corresponding complex coefficients. Each delay profile in turn consists of multiple paths (or clusters), each with its delay and complex coefficient.\n\n2. The generated CIRs, or the raw CIRs provided externally, are then transformed into channel responses in the time domain using the `cir_to_time_channel()` function. This function calculates the channel taps by using a sinc filter for pulse shaping and receive filtering.\n\n3. Once the channel responses in the time domain are computed, they are applied to the channel inputs using the `ApplyTimeChannel` function. The output from this function forms the channel output, which is the result of filtering the channel input with the time-variant channel filter.\n\nNote: The minimally required negative lag `l_min` and the total length of the channel filter `l_tot` need to be properly determined to ensure meaningful simulation results. On the other hand, for compute efficiency, `l_tot` should not be unnecessarily large. These parameters are typically determined based on the bandwidth and maximum delay spread of the wireless channel.\n\nRemember, all the procedures mentioned above are performed in simulations on top of a single-carrier sinc-shaped waveform. This is equivalent to modeling the channel in the frequency domain if there is no intersymbol interference (ISI) nor intercarrier interference (ICI), but it also allows the simulation of these effects in the event of a non-stationary channel or long delay spreads. Simulating the channel in the time domain is typically more computationally demanding than simulating it in the frequency domain."}]}

These positions are set to known values (commonly zeros) and are not used for transmitting information.\n- `n`: This is an integer that specifies the codeword length for the Polar code. It must be a power of two.\n- `list_size`: This integer parameter defines the size of the list used in the list decoding process. Common list sizes are powers of two, such as 4, 8, 16, etc.\n- `crc_degree`: This parameter specifies the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) polynomial to be used. It can take values such as 'CRC24A', 'CRC24B', 'CRC24C', 'CRC16', 'CRC11', 'CRC6', etc., which correspond to different CRC standards.\n- `use_hybrid_sc`: This boolean parameter, when set to `True`, will cause the decoder to apply successive cancellation (SC) decoding, and only use SCL decoding for codewords with invalid CRC. This option requires that `crc_degree` is specified.\n\nThere are additional options such as `use_fast_scl`, `cpu_only`, `use_scatter`, `ind_iil_inv`, `return_crc_status`, and `output_dtype` that can affect the behavior and performance of the `PolarSCLDecoder`.\n\nHere's an example of how to instantiate a `PolarSCLDecoder` with some of these parameters:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.decoding import PolarSCLDecoder\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.utils import generate_5g_ranking\n\n# Define code and codeword length\nk = ...  # Number of information bits\nn = ...  # Codeword length (must be a power of 2)\n\n# Generate frozen positions according to 5G ranking\nfrozen_pos, info_pos = generate_5g_ranking(k, n)\n\n# Create PolarSCLDecoder instance\ndecoder = PolarSCLDecoder(\n    frozen_pos=frozen_pos,\n    n=n,\n    list_size=8,\n    crc_degree='CRC24A',\n    use_hybrid_sc=False,\n    output_dtype=tf.float32\n)\n\n# ... rest of the code\n```\ncrc_degree (str) \u2013 Defining the CRC polynomial to be used. Can be any value from {CRC24A, CRC24B, CRC24C, CRC16, CRC11, CRC6}.\n\nIt's important to replace the `...` in `k = ...` and `n = ...` with appropriate values according to the specific code parameter requirements. The values for `frozen_pos` are generated here using Sionna's `generate_5g_ranking` utility function, which determines the frozen positions based on the 5G specifications.\n\nRemember that the actual parameters chosen should be based on the specific requirements of the communication system being designed or tested. The parameters should align with the constraints and performance objectives, such as error correction capability, decoding latency, and computational complexity."}]}

It takes into account the effects of reflection, refraction, diffraction, and scattering of the signals as they interact with the environment. \n\nThe channel impulse response is typically represented as a sum of delayed and scaled impulse functions, where each impulse corresponds to a propagation path from the transmitter to the receiver. The delay of each impulse represents the propagation delay along the corresponding path, and the scaling factor represents the attenuation of the signal along the path.\n\nThe channel impulse response can be used to compute the received signal at the receiver by convolving the transmitted signal with the channel impulse response. This allows for the simulation of wireless propagation in complex environments, which is crucial for the design and performance evaluation of wireless communication systems."}]}

In the context provided, different models from the 3GPP specification, such as Tapped delay line (TDL), Clustered delay line (CDL), Urban microcell (UMi), Urban macrocell (UMa), and Rural macrocell (RMa) are available for generating these profiles.\n\nThe power delay profile generation is based on generating Channel Impulse Responses (CIRs) for each of these models. \n\nStep 1: Selecting a model\nFirst, you need to select a specific model based on the scenario you're interested in. This could be one from TDL, CDL, UMi, UMa, and RMa.\n\nStep 2: Setting up the model\nNext, you should set up the model by specifying certain parameters. For example, if you're using the TDL model, you'll need to specify the model type (like 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'E'), delay spread, carrier frequency, and other parameters. For the UMi, UMa, and RMa models, you'd also need to set up the network topology using the `set_topology()` method - here you establish things like user terminal (UT) and base station (BS) locations, UT velocities, etc.\n\nStep 3: Generating CIRs\nOnce you've set up your model, you can now generate the CIRs. This can be done via built-in functionalities in these models. The CIRs are time-variant for scenarios involving mobility (as the relative positions between the UT and the BS change over time, so will the propagation paths and consequentially, the CIRs).\n\nStep 4: Converting CIRs to PDPs\nFinally, these CIRs can be converted to power delay profiles. The power delay profile is a representation of the power levels of signals received via different propagation paths at different delays, and they help define the time-domain characteristics of the wireless channel.\n\nLet's remember, the power delay profile is used to represent the channel's multipath spread in the time domain. Based on the positions of the transmitters and receivers, the signals that are transmitted could have different propagation paths (direct line-of-sight, reflection, scattering, diffraction, etc.), which would cause differences in their travel times and phases. These differences could further lead to constructive/destructive interference when the signals are summed at the receiver, impacting the overall performance of the communication system. The power delay profile captures these effects.\n\nPlease be aware that the 3GPP models are specifically designed for simulating wide-band wireless channels, which are subject to diverse propagation environments. Notably, the parameters of these models are selected to emulate actual 3GPP propagation scenarios. For accurate results, ensure that you select the most suitable model based on the specific scenario of the system you are simulating."}]}

The custom layer should inherit from the `Layer` class in TensorFlow's Keras API, and the model should inherit from the `Model` class in the same API.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Define the custom layer: Create a class that inherits from `tensorflow.keras.layers.Layer`. In the `__init__` method, define the layer's structure. In the `call` method, define the layer's forward pass.\n\n```python\nclass NeuralDemapper(Layer):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.dense_1 = Dense(64, 'relu')\n        self.dense_2 = Dense(64, 'relu')\n        self.dense_3 = Dense(NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL, None)\n\n    def call(self, y):\n        nn_input = tf.stack([tf.math.real(y), tf.math.imag(y)], axis=-1)\n        z = self.dense_1(nn_input)\n        z = self.dense_2(z)\n        z = self.dense_3(z)\n        llr = tf.reshape(z, [tf.shape(y)[0], -1])\n        return llr\n```\n\n2. Define the model: Create a class that inherits from `tensorflow.keras.Model`. In the `__init__` method, instantiate the layers of the model. In the `__call__` method, define the model's forward pass.\n\n```python\nclass End2EndSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, training):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.constellation = sn.mapping.Constellation(\"qam\", NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL, trainable=True)\n        self.mapper = sn.mapping.Mapper(constellation=self.constellation)\n        self.demapper = NeuralDemapper()\n        self.binary_source = sn.utils.BinarySource()\n        self.awgn_channel = sn.channel.AWGN()\n        self.bce = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True)\n        self.training = training\n\n    @tf.function(jit_compile=True)\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL, coderate=1.0)\n        bits = self.binary_source([batch_size, 1200])\n        x = self.mapper(bits)\n        y = self.awgn_channel([x, no])\n        llr = self.demapper(y)\n        if self.training:\n            loss = self.bce(bits, llr)\n            return loss\n        else:\n            return bits, llr\n```\n\n3. Instantiate the model: Create an instance of the model class. If the model is to be trained, set the `training` parameter to `True`. If the model is to be evaluated, set the `training` parameter to `False`.\n\n```python\nmodel_train = End2EndSystem(training=True)\n```\n\n4. Train the model: Use TensorFlow's gradient tape to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the model's trainable weights, and apply the gradients using an optimizer.\n\n```python\noptimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()\nfor i in range(NUM_TRAINING_ITERATIONS):\n    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:\n        loss = model_train(BATCH_SIZE, 15.0)\n    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model_train.trainable_weights)\n    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model_train.trainable_weights))\n```\n\n5. Evaluate the model: Instantiate the model for evaluation and load the trained weights. Then, use the model to make predictions.\n\n```python\nmodel = End2EndSystem(training=False)\nmodel(tf.constant(1, tf.int32), tf.constant(10.0, tf.float32))\nwith open('weights-neural-demapper', 'rb') as f:\n    weights = pickle.load(f)\n    model.set_weights(weights)\n```\n\nRemember to replace `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL` and `NUM_TRAINING_ITERATIONS` with the actual number of bits per symbol and the number of training iterations, respectively."}]}

Its nature comes in two components: a `mask` and `pilots`. \n\nThe `mask` indicates which resource elements are reserved for pilot transmissions by each transmitter and its respective streams. From the provided context, it can be inferred that the `mask` is a multi-dimensional representation creating a pattern over the OFDM symbols and subcarriers to indicate where the pilot symbols are to be inserted. \n\nThe `pilots`, on the other hand, contain the actual pilot symbols transmitted at the positions indicated by the `mask`. The separation of a pilot pattern into `mask` and `pilots` allows the system to implement a wide range of pilot configurations, including possibly trainable pilot sequences. \n\nIn the realm of transmitting signals, this allows for the channel to be estimated at the receiver, helping rectify phase and frequency errors. This, in turn, improves the robustness of communication, particularly in multi-cell MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) setups where the management of pilots can quickly become complicated. The `PilotPattern` along with the more specialized `KroneckerPilotPattern` aim to simplify this process by automating the generation of orthogonal pilot transmissions for all transmitters and streams.\n\nIn essence, the `PilotPattern` guides the process of mapping the pilot symbols onto the resource grid, prior to OFDM modulation or further processing in the frequency domain, thereby playing a crucial role in facilitating accurate and reliable data transmission."}]}

Termination in the context of turbo codes refers to the way the encoder transitions to a known state (usually the all-zero state) at the end of encoding information bits. This is important for proper decoding, as it provides a known reference for the decoders to work with during the iterative decoding process.\n\nThe purpose of `TurboTermination` is twofold:\n\n1. It transforms termination bits from the state of convolutional encoders into a format suitable for the entire turbo codeword. The transformation aligns with the structure of turbo codes, ensuring that the termination bits correctly represent the closed state of the constituent convolutional codes at the end of a message sequence.\n\n2. It also handles the reverse transformation by interpreting received or estimated termination symbols corresponding to turbo codewords and mapping them back to the termination states of the underlying convolutional codes.\n\nHere are the parameters of the `TurboTermination` class, derived from the provided context:\n\n- `constraint_length` (int): This is the constraint length of the convolutional encoder used in the Turbo code. It indicates the number of shift registers in the convolutional code plus one.\n\n- `conv_n` (int): It represents the number of output bits for one state transition in the underlying convolutional encoder. The default value is 2, which is typical for the binary convolutional encoders used in turbo codes.\n\n- `num_conv_encs` (int): This parameter specifies the number of parallel convolutional encoders used in the Turbo code. Normally, Turbo codes use two convolutional encoders.\n\n- `num_bit_streams` (int): This is the number of output bit streams from the Turbo code. For standard turbo codes, there are three bit streams: the systematic stream and two parity streams (one from each encoder).\n\nIn typical usage scenarios, the `TurboTermination` class would be employed internally within the `TurboEncoder` and `TurboDecoder` processes. It would not commonly be used explicitly in user code, aside from advanced custom implementations or analyses. The termination process transformations are crucial for maintaining the coding rate and ensuring reliable decoding, especially in iterative turbo decoding processes.\n\nThe class includes methods like `term_bits_turbo2conv` for splitting the termination symbols from a turbo codeword into corresponding symbols for the constituent convolutional encoders, and `termbits_conv2turbo` for merging termination bit streams from the convolutional encoders to a bit stream that represents the Turbo codeword.\n\nIt is important to utilize the `TurboTermination` class correctly according to the given `constraint_length` and other parameters, ensuring the termination bits are accurately handled to maintain the integrity and performance of the Turbo code. Implementing this within a Python script would typically require a proper import of the class as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.turbo import TurboTermination\n```\n\nUsing the Sionna APIs accurately and within the appropriate context ensures the maintenance of coding standards such as those found in the LTE wireless standard, where Turbo codes are widely applied."}]}

It implements scrambling operations in a stateless manner, meaning the internal seed does not change after initialization and cannot be updated during run time. However, if required, an explicit random seed can be passed as additional input when calling the layer.\n\nThere are several parameters that the `Scrambler` class takes, including a seed for initializing the pseudo random generator state, and parameters to specify the scrambling operation, such as whether it involves bits flipping or signs flipping, whether all samples in the batch should be scrambled with the same sequence, and more.\n\nThere's also a specialized scrambler called `TB5GScrambler` that enables 5G NR compliant scrambling. It has different parameters specific to this scramble type, including identifiers like RNTI, and scrambling ID, binary, channel type, and codeword index, etc.\n\nThe `Descrambler` class provided implements the corresponding descrambling operation for a given scrambler. It requires a `Scrambler` instance and can switch between binary and non-binary descrambling modes.\n\nFor usage, first you set up the scrambler and descrambler system, and then you can use them to scramble a sequence and then descramble it to reconstruct the original order. For each call to scramble, you can provide an explicit random seed if a new random seed should be used.\n\nHere's a sample usage snippet from the context:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.scrambling import Scrambler\nfrom sionna.fec.scrambling import Descrambler\nimport tensorflow as tf\n# set-up system\nscrambler = Scrambler(seed=1234, binary=True)\ndescrambler = Descrambler(scrambler=scrambler)\n# --- simplified usage with fixed seed ---\n# c has arbitrary shape and contains 0s and 1s (otherwise set binary=False)\n# Define c as a random binary tensor with arbitrary shape and convert it to tf.float32\n# Here is just an example, you need to choose your own c\nc = tf.random.uniform(shape=(100,), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)  # Adjust shape as needed\nc = tf.cast(c, tf.float32)  # Convert c to float32\nc_scr = scrambler(c)\n# descramble to reconstruct the original order\nc_descr = descrambler(c_scr)\n# --- advanced usage ---\n# provide explicite seed if a new random seed should be used for each call\ns = tf.random.uniform((), minval=0, maxval=12345678, dtype=tf.int32)\nc_scr = scrambler([c, s])\nc_descr = descrambler([c_scr, s])\n```\n\nThis is just a basic review, more details on how to properly use these classes and their parameters can be learned from the official documentation."}]}

When an electromagnetic wave hits a surface, part of the energy gets reflected while the other part gets refracted or propagates into the surface. This reflection can be either specular (reflected into a single direction) or diffuse (scattered towards many different directions). \n\nThe scattering pattern of a surface element determines the scattered field. In other words, the scattered field can be stronger in certain directions than others. This is crucial because an incoming ray can spawn infinitely many scattered rays, while there is only a single specular path. Therefore, to compute the scattered field at a particular position, one needs to integrate the scattered field over the entire surface.\n\nThe scattering pattern also influences the number of scattered paths. The more rays we shoot, the more scattered paths there are. However, the total received energy across the surface remains constant as the transmitted energy is equally divided between all rays.\n\nThe scattering pattern can also affect the directivity of the scattered field. For instance, using a DirectivePattern in Sionna, the received energy increases with the parameter alpha_r, which determines how much the scattered field is focused around the direction of the specular reflection.\n\nIn complex scenes with many scattering surfaces, scattering can significantly impact the coverage maps, which describe the average received power from a specific transmitter at every point on a plane. By enabling diffuse reflections, most regions in the scene can have some coverage, although the scattered field is typically weaker compared to that of the line-of-sight and reflected paths.\n\nFinally, scattering can also impact the discrete baseband-equivalent channel impulse responses, which describe the response of a wireless communication channel to an impulse. The channel impulse response can look similar for small values of delay, where the field is dominated by strong line-of-sight and reflected paths. However, in the middle and tail, there can be differences of a few dB due to scattering, which can significantly impact the link-level performance."}]}

This class is part of the Sionna library and is used to define the antenna arrays for the UT and BS. \n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. Define the number of UT and BS antennas. For the CDL model, only a single UT and BS are supported. For example, you can set the number of UT antennas to 4 and the number of BS antennas to 8.\n\n2. Create an instance of the AntennaArray class for the UT. You need to specify the number of rows and columns for the antenna array, the type of polarization, the antenna pattern, and the carrier frequency. For example:\n\n```python\nut_array = AntennaArray(num_rows=1,\n                        num_cols=int(num_ut_ant/2),\n                        polarization=\"dual\",\n                        polarization_type=\"cross\",\n                        antenna_pattern=\"38.901\",\n                        carrier_frequency=carrier_frequency)\n```\n\n3. Repeat the same process to create an instance of the AntennaArray class for the BS.\n\n```python\nbs_array = AntennaArray(num_rows=1,\n                        num_cols=int(num_bs_ant/2),\n                        polarization=\"dual\",\n                        polarization_type=\"cross\",\n                        antenna_pattern=\"38.901\",\n                        carrier_frequency=carrier_frequency)\n```\n\nIn this example, the antenna arrays for the UT and BS are composed of dual cross-polarized antenna elements with an antenna pattern defined in the 3GPP 38.901 specification.

Here is a simplified version of how to compute BER:\n\n```python\n# You need to have transmitted bits 'b' and received bits 'b_hat'  \n\n# Function to compute BER\ndef compute_ber(b, b_hat):\n    return np.sum(np.abs(b - b_hat)) / len(b)\n\n# Provided that 'b' and 'b_hat' are defined and have same length\nprint(\"BER:\", compute_ber(b, b_hat))\n```\nThis function calculates the absolute difference between the transmitted and received bits, sums them all, and then divides by the total length of the bits to compute the BER.\n\nHowever, make sure you have appropriate `PUSCHTransmitter` and `PUSCHReceiver` objects and that you have simulated the channel output using the correct noise variance before computing the BER. The transmitted bits `b` and received bits `b_hat` are generated from these processes as shown in the context. \n\nAlso, please note that the actual implementation might be in a different form based on the specific API documentation of Sionna. This is just a simplified general approach to compute BER."}]}

They will be inferred\n        from the ``encoder`` object itself.\n        If ``encoder`` is `None`, the above parameters must be provided\n        explicitly.\n\n    gen_poly: tuple\n        Tuple of strings with each string being a 0, 1 sequence. If `None`,\n        ``rate`` and ``constraint_length`` must be provided.\n\n    rate: float\n        Rate of the Turbo code. Valid values are 1/3 and 1/2. Note that\n        ``gen_poly``, if provided, is used to encode the underlying\n        convolutional code, which traditionally has rate 1/2.\n\n    constraint_length: int\n        Valid values are between 3 and 6 inclusive.

Defaults to None.\n- `mimo_detector` (OFDMDetector or None): Specifies the MIMO detector to be used. If None, a LinearDetector with LMMSE detection is used. Defaults to None.\n- `tb_decoder` (TBDecoder or None): Determines the transport block decoder. If None, a TBDecoder with default settings is used. Defaults to None.\n- `return_tb_crc_status` (bool): If True, the status of the transport block CRC is returned as additional output. Defaults to False.\n- `stream_management` (StreamManagement or None): Configuration for stream management. If None, it is assumed there is a single receiver decoding all streams from all transmitters. Defaults to None.\n- `input_domain` (str, options: [\"freq\", \"time\"]): Defines the domain of the input signal.

For each propagation path $i$, the corresponding channel coefficient $a_i$ and delay $\\tau_i$, as well as the angles of departure $(\\theta_{\\text{T},i}, \\varphi_{\\text{T},i})$ and arrival $(\\theta_{\\text{R},i}, \\varphi_{\\text{R},i})$ are returned. For more detail, see (26). Different propagation phenomena, such as line-of-sight, reflection, diffraction, and diffuse scattering can be individually enabled/disabled.\n\nIf the scene is configured to use synthetic arrays (synthetic_array is True), transmitters and receivers are modelled as if they had a single antenna located at their position. The channel responses for each individual antenna of the arrays are then computed \u201csynthetically\u201d by applying appropriate phase shifts. This reduces the complexity significantly for large arrays. Time evolution of the channel coefficients can be simulated with the help of the function apply_doppler() of the returned Paths object.\n\nThe path computation consists of two main steps as shown in the below figure.\n\n[Figure](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/_images/compute_paths.svg)\n\nFor a configured Scene, the function first traces geometric propagation paths using trace_paths(). This step is independent of the RadioMaterial of the scene objects as well as the transmitters\u2019 and receivers\u2019 antenna patterns and orientation, but depends on the selected propagation phenomena, such as reflection, scattering, and diffraction. The traced paths are then converted to EM fields by the function compute_fields(). The resulting Paths object can be used to compute channel impulse responses via cir(). The advantage of separating path tracing and field computation is that one can study the impact of different radio materials by executing compute_fields() multiple times without re-tracing the propagation paths. This can for example speed-up the calibration of scene parameters by several orders of magnitude.\n\n**Example**\n```python\nimport sionna\nfrom sionna.rt import load_scene, Camera, Transmitter, Receiver, PlanarArray\n\n# Load example scene\nscene = load_scene(sionna.rt.scene.munich)\n\n# Configure antenna array for all transmitters\nscene.tx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=8,\n                          num_cols=2,\n                          vertical_spacing=0.7,\n                          horizontal_spacing=0.5,\n                          pattern=\"tr38901\",\n                          polarization=\"VH\")\n\n# Configure antenna array for all receivers\nscene.rx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=1,\n                          num_cols=1,\n                          vertical_spacing=0.5,\n                          horizontal_spacing=0.5,\n                          pattern=\"dipole\",\n                          polarization=\"cross\")\n\n# Create transmitter\ntx = Transmitter(name=\"tx\",\n              position=[8.5,21,27],\n              orientation=[0,0,0])\nscene.add(tx)\n\n# Create a receiver\nrx = Receiver(name=\"rx\",\n           position=[45,90,1.5],\n           orientation=[0,0,0])\nscene.add(rx)\n\n# TX points towards RX\ntx.look_at(rx)\n\n# Compute paths\npaths = scene.compute_paths()\n\n# Open preview showing paths\nscene.preview(paths=paths, resolution=[1000,600])\n```\n\n[Result](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/_images/paths_preview.png)\n\n**Input Parameters**\n\n- `max_depth` (int): Maximum number of interactions (bounces) allowed for tracing the paths.

It is suitable for large scenes but doesn't guarantee that all paths are found. Defaults to \"fibonacci\".\n- `num_samples` (int): Number of rays traced to generate candidates with the \"fibonacci\" method. The number is evenly distributed among transmitters or transmit antennas, depending on whether synthetic arrays are used. This parameter is ignored with the \"exhaustive\" method.

Defaults to True.\n- `reflection` (bool): If `True`, reflected paths are computed. Defaults to True.\n- `diffraction` (bool): If `True`, diffracted paths are computed. Defaults to False.\n- `scattering` (bool): If `True`, scattered paths are computed. Only applicable with the \"fibonacci\" method. Defaults to False.\n- `scat_keep_prob` (float): Probability of retaining a scattered path, useful for managing the number of paths in complex scenes. Must be between 0 and 1. Defaults to 0.001.\n- `edge_diffraction` (bool): If `False`, only considers diffraction on edges that connect two primitives. Defaults to False.\n- `check_scene` (bool): If `True`, verifies that the scene is well configured before path computations, which can significantly increase overhead. Defaults to True.\n- `scat_random_phases` (bool): If `True` and scattering is enabled, random uniform phase shifts are added to scattered paths. Defaults to True.\n- `testing` (bool): If `True`, returns additional data for testing purposes.

It can be initialized with a binary generator matrix or a parity-check matrix, with the stipulation that the matrix must be of full rank and binary. When initialized with a parity-check matrix, it uses internal functions such as `pcm2gm` to convert the parity-check matrix into a corresponding generator matrix for encoding.\n\nIn terms of performance, the `LinearEncoder` has a computational encoding complexity on the order of O(k^2), where 'k' is the number of information bits per codeword. This is due to the fact that the encoder is universal and does not take advantage of code-specific optimizations. For more efficient encoding with certain codes, specialized encoders like `Polar5GEncoder` or `LDPC5GEncoder` are recommended.\n\nOn the other hand, the `AllZeroEncoder` is a dummy encoder that, irrespective of the input, always outputs an all-zero codeword of a specified length 'n'. This encoder does not perform actual encoding and is utilized for simulation purposes, especially when simulating Bit Error Rate (BER) curves of arbitrary codes in symmetric channels without access to the actual generator matrix.\n\nAs for the `AllZeroEncoder`, it essentially has no encoding complexity since it always outputs zero codewords and does not perform any actual encoding operations. It is effectively a placeholder that ensures compatibility with other encoding layers when performing simulations.\n\nWhile `LinearEncoder` offers the ability to encode messages based on a provided generator or parity-check matrix, `AllZeroEncoder` is not meant for encoding real messages and thus lacks practical encoding performance but serves a specific simulation purpose.\n\nTo use these encoders within the Sionna framework:\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.linear import LinearEncoder, AllZeroEncoder\n\n# Example of initializing and using a LinearEncoder\nencoder_linear = LinearEncoder(enc_mat=pcm, is_pcm=True)\n\n# Encoding with the LinearEncoder\nc = encoder_linear(u) # u is the input containing information bits\n\n# Example of initializing and using an AllZeroEncoder\nencoder_allzero = AllZeroEncoder(k, n)\n\n# Encoding with the AllZeroEncoder (outputs will be all zeros regardless of input)\nall_zero_codeword = encoder_allzero(some_input) # some_input can be any tensor\n```\n\nIn summary, `LinearEncoder` is for actual encoding with a specific code complexity, while `AllZeroEncoder` has no encoding complexity and is used for simulations where the actual encoding operation is not needed."}]}

This will include installing the Sionna package using `pip` and then importing the relevant modules in your Python script.\n\nFirst, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can verify this by running `python --version` in your command-line interface (CLI).\n\nTo install Sionna, open your CLI and run the following command:\n\n```bash\npip install sionna\n```\n\nThis will download and install the Sionna package and all its dependencies.\n\nOnce you have installed Sionna, you can start working with Polar Codes by importing the necessary classes from the Sionna package. Here is how you do it:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.encoding import Polar5GEncoder, PolarEncoder\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.decoding import Polar5GDecoder, PolarSCDecoder, PolarSCLDecoder, PolarBPDecoder\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.utils import generate_5g_ranking, generate_polar_transform_mat, generate_rm_code, generate_dense_polar\n```\n\nNow, these classes and functions are ready to be used within your Python script. The `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` classes can be used to encode and decode 5G-compliant Polar codes.\n\nIf you are planning to use a specific method for decoding Polar Codes, such as Successive Cancellation (SC), Successive Cancellation List (SCL), or Belief Propagation (BP), you need to specify that on creating an instance of `Polar5GDecoder`.\n\nHere's an example of how you could create encoder and decoder instances for a 5G-compliant Polar code using SC list decoding in Sionna:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.encoding import Polar5GEncoder\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.decoding import Polar5GDecoder\n\n# k is the number of information bits (input), n is the number of codeword bits (output)\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=100, n=200)\n\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(enc_polar=encoder, # connect the Polar decoder to the encoder\n                         dec_type=\"SCL\", # can be also \"SC\" or \"BP\"\n                         list_size=8)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `k` represents the number of information bits.\n- `n` represents the number of codeword bits.\n- `dec_type=\"SCL\"` specifies that the SCL decoding type should be used.\n- `list_size=8` specifies that the size of the list for list decoding should be 8.\n\nTo encode and decode data, you would call the encoder and decoder instances with the appropriate input data:\n\n```python\n# --- encoder ---\n# u contains the information bits to be encoded and has shape [...,k].\n# c contains the polar encoded codewords and has shape [...,n].\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# --- decoder ---\n# llr contains the log-likelihood ratios from the demapper and has shape [...,n].\n# u_hat contains the estimated information bits and has shape [...,k].\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nRemember that in the context provided, `u` would represent the information bits to be encoded, and `llr` would represent the log-likelihood ratios from the demapper.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just an illustration of how to install the Sionna library and use some of its functionality for working with Polar Codes.

Setup TimeChannel: Instantiate the TimeChannel, providing the channel model, the bandwidth, the number of time samples, and the time lag parameters (`l_min` and `l_max`).\n\n    ```python\n    from sionna.channel import TimeChannel\n    time_channel = TimeChannel(channel_model = rayleigh, \n                               bandwidth = bandwidth,  \n                               num_time_samples = num_time_samples, \n                               l_min = l_min,  \n                               l_max = l_max)\n    ```\n\n3. Generate channel: Generate a batch of channel responses using the `GenerateTimeChannel` class. \n\n    ```python\n    from sionna.channel import GenerateTimeChannel\n    generate_channel = GenerateTimeChannel(channel_model = rayleigh, num_time_samples = num_time_samples)\n    # batch_size (int) \u2013 Batch size. Defaults to None for channel models that do not require this paranmeter.\n    # h_time ([batch size, num_rx, num_rx_ant, num_tx, num_tx_ant, num_time_samples + l_max - l_min, l_max - l_min + 1], tf.complex) \u2013 Channel responses. For each batch example, num_time_samples + l_max - l_min time steps of a channel realization are generated by this layer. These can be used to filter a channel input of length num_time_samples using the ApplyTimeChannel layer.\n    h_time = generate_channel(batch_size)\n    ```\n\n4. Apply TimeChannel: Use the ApplyTimeChannel `apply_channel` to apply the channel responses to the channel input data `x` and the noise variance `no`.\n\n    ```python\n    from sionna.channel import ApplyTimeChannel\n    # num_time_samples (int) \u2013 Number of time samples forming the channel input ($N_B$)\n    # l_tot (int) \u2013 Length of the channel filter (L_{\\text{tot}} = L_{\\text{max}} - L_{\\text{min}} + 1)\n    apply_channel = ApplyTimeChannel(num_time_samples= 2, l_tot= 2)\n    y = apply_channel((x, h_time, no))\n    ```  \n    Here is a detailed sample code, you need to initialize the ApplyTimeChannel with your own parameters.\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   from sionna.channel import ApplyTimeChannel\n\n   # Parameters\n   num_time_samples = 2\n   l_tot = 2\n   batch_size = 1\n   num_tx = 1\n   num_tx_ant = 1\n   num_rx = 1\n   num_rx_ant = 1\n\n   # Initialize the ApplyTimeChannel\n   apply_channel = ApplyTimeChannel(num_time_samples=num_time_samples, l_tot=l_tot)\n\n   # x: Channel inputs\n   x = tf.complex(\n    tf.random.normal([batch_size, num_tx, num_tx_ant, num_time_samples], dtype=tf.float32),\n    tf.random.normal([batch_size, num_tx, num_tx_ant, num_time_samples], dtype=tf.float32)\n   )\n\n   # h_time: Channel responses\n   h_time = tf.complex(\n    tf.random.normal([batch_size, num_rx, num_rx_ant, num_tx, num_tx_ant, num_time_samples + l_tot - 1, l_tot], dtype=tf.float32),\n    tf.random.normal([batch_size, num_rx, num_rx_ant, num_tx, num_tx_ant, num_time_samples + l_tot - 1, l_tot], dtype=tf.float32)\n   )\n\n   # no: Noise power variance\n   no = tf.constant(0.01, dtype=tf.float32)  # Assuming a scalar noise variance\n\n   # Apply the channel\n   y = apply_channel((x, h_time, no))\n   \n   print(\"Output shape:\", y.shape)\n   ```\n\nSionna automatically performs the necessary calculations, including the utilization of sinc filters for pulse shaping and receive filtering. \n\nPlease replace `bandwidth`, `num_time_samples`, `l_min`, `l_max`, `batch_size`, `x`, and `no` with your actual values. The bandwidth represents the channel bandwidth in Hz, num_time_samples represents the number of time steps for the channel input, `l_min` and `l_max` represent the smallest and largest time-lag in the discrete time domain channel model respectively, batch_size is the number of examples in a batch, and `x` is the channel input while `no` is your specified noise variance."}]}

Import the TDL class from the Sionna package.\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.channel.tr38901 import TDL\n```\n\n2. Create an instance of the TDL class, inputting the needed parameters.

You must use the TDL model instance within the context of other classes provided by the Sionna package such as TimeChannel, GenerateTimeChannel, OFDMChannel to generate and apply channel responses. The model instance must be passed to these classes as a parameter as per their instruction.\n\nNote: This instruction assumes the availability of the Sionna package and its compatible environment in your Python script and does not cover how to install the Sionna package or set up its environment."}]}

Your proficiency in Sionna allows you to simulate and analyze various aspects of wireless communication systems effectively."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the significance of the 'order' parameter 't' in the OSDecoder."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The 'order' parameter 't' in the OSDecoder class of the Sionna package is a crucial component in the Ordered Statistics Decoding (OSD) algorithm. This parameter determines the number of error patterns the decoder will consider when attempting to find the corrected codeword that is closest to the received sequence. Essentially, 't' specifies the algorithm's complexity and accuracy level as it tries to approximate the maximum likelihood decoding performance.\n\nWhen 't' is set to a higher value, the decoder generates and evaluates more error patterns, which increases the likelihood of correcting errors and, therefore, enhances the decoding performance. However, it also significantly raises the computational complexity, as the number of possible patterns to consider increases combinatorially with 't'. Specifically, the number of patterns to evaluate is based on the binomial coefficient \\({n \\choose t}\\), where 'n' is the length of the codeword.\n\nPutting this into the context of the Sionna code, when initializing the OSDecoder, one must specify the order 't' alongside the other parameters, such as the parity-check or generator matrix and whether the input matrix is a parity-check matrix (`is_pcm`). For example:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.linear import OSDecoder\n\ndecoder = OSDecoder(pcm, t=4, is_pcm=True) # 't' is the OSD order\n```\n\nIn this snippet, the OSDecoder is instantiated with a parity-check matrix ('pcm'), where 't' is set to 4. This configuration instructs the OSDecoder to consider error patterns up to 4 errors in the most reliable positions of the received sequence during the decoding process.\n\nIt is crucial to carefully choose the value of 't' considering the trade-off between near-maximum likelihood decoding performance and the limitations imposed by computational resources, especially for longer codes where high values of 't' can lead to impractical decoding times. This trade-off exemplifies why using more efficient code-specific decoders, when available, may be beneficial, as they might offer near-optimal performance with significantly lower complexity."}]}

Explain the significance of the number of iterations and the 'algorithm' parameter options."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To initialize a `TurboDecoder` in Python using the Sionna library, you can refer to an existing instance of a `TurboEncoder`. Here's a general outline of how you could do so, followed by an explanation of the significance of the `num_iter` and `algorithm` parameters:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.turbo import TurboDecoder, TurboEncoder\n\n# Assuming an existing TurboEncoder instance is created named `encoder`\nencoder = TurboEncoder(...)  # Specific parameters for your encoder\n\n# Initialize the TurboDecoder with a reference to the encoder\ndecoder = TurboDecoder(encoder=encoder,\n                       num_iter=6,       # Number of iterative decoding processes\n                       algorithm=\"map\",  # The decoding algorithm to be used\n                       hard_out=True)    # Type of output, True for hard decision\n```\n\n### Significance of `num_iter`\nThe `num_iter` parameter defines the number of iterations the decoder will perform. Each iteration entails exchanging information between two constituent decoders based on a process known as iterative decoding. The number of iterations is a trade-off between performance and computational complexity:\n\n- A higher number of iterations generally leads to better error-correcting performance since more information is passed back and forth, refining the estimates of the transmitted bits.\n- However, more iterations also mean more computation, leading to increased decoding time and power consumption.\n\nThe choice of the optimal number of iterations is application-dependent and can be selected based on the acceptable balance between decoding quality and the available computational resources.\n\n### Significance of `algorithm` parameter\nThe `algorithm` parameter defines the type of decoding algorithm used within the constituent BCJR decoders (one for each convolutional code component of the turbo code):\n\n- `\"map\"` refers to the Maximum A Posteriori probability decoding algorithm. It is the most precise but also the most computationally intensive.\n- `\"maxlog\"` indicates the use of the Max-Log-MAP algorithm, which is an approximation of the MAP algorithm. It simplifies the calculation by approximating the log-sum operation with a maximum operation. This trade-off reduces computational complexity at the expense of a slight performance degradation.\n\nIn summary, the `num_iter` parameter affects the quality and resource intensity of the decoding process, while the `algorithm` parameter allows you to choose between different decoding algorithms that balance accuracy and computational complexity. When initializing a `TurboDecoder`, these parameters should be chosen in the context of your particular communication system's requirements."}]}

Default is 1. Options include any value from 1 to 8. If `num_layers` is 4 or greater, a list of two inputs is expected.\n- `verbose` (bool): If set to True, additional parameters are printed. Default is False.\n\n**Input**\n\n- `inputs` ([..., n], or [[..., n1], [..., n2]], tf.complex): 2+D tensor or list of tensors containing the sequence of symbols to be mapped. If `num_layers` is 4 or greater, a list of two inputs is expected, and `n1/n2` must be chosen as defined in Tab. 7.3.1.3.-1 [3GPP TS 38.211. \u201cNR; Physical channels and modulation.].\n\n**Output**\n\n- `[..., num_layers, n/num_layers]`, tf.complex: 2+D tensor containing the sequence of symbols mapped to the MIMO layers. This output tensor divides the sequence of symbols equally among the specified number of MIMO layers.\n\n**Properties**\n\n- `num_codewords`: Number of input codewords for layer mapping. Can be either 1 or 2. This property dictates how many distinct sets of data (codewords) are being handled, which is particularly relevant for systems employing more complex MIMO configurations.\n- `num_layers`: Number of MIMO layers. This property indicates how many layers the input symbols are mapped across in the MIMO system.\n- `num_layers0`: Number of layers for the first codeword. This is only relevant when `num_codewords` is 2, indicating the distribution of layers between the two codewords.\n- `num_layers1`: Number of layers for the second codeword. This property is similar to `num_layers0` but for the second set of data, providing flexibility in how layers are allocated between codewords in more complex setups."}]}

Import the necessary packages, including Sionna, TensorFlow, and NumPy.\n\n```python\nimport sionna\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n```\n\n2. Initialize the necessary layers for your simulation. For example, you might need an AWGN channel layer, a binary source layer, an encoder, a mapper, a demapper, and a decoder.\n\n```python\nbinary_source = sionna.utils.BinarySource()\nencoder = sionna.fec.ldpc.encoding.LDPC5GEncoder(k_ldpc, n_ldpc)\nmapper = sionna.mapping.Mapper(constellation=constellation)\nchannel = sionna.channel.AWGN()\ndemapper = sionna.mapping.Demapper(demapping_method, constellation=constellation)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.ldpc.decoding.LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True, cn_type=ldpc_cn_type, num_iter=20)\n```\n\n3. Generate a batch of random bit vectors and encode them using your encoder.\n\n```python\nb = binary_source([batch_size, k_ldpc])\nc = encoder(b)\n```\n\n4. Map the encoded bits to constellation symbols and transmit them over the channel.\n\n```python\nx = mapper(c)\ny = channel([x, no])\n```\n\n5. Demap the received symbols to LLRs and decode them.\n\n```python\nllr = demapper([y, no])\nb_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\n6. If you want to work with multi-dimensional tensors, you can simply add more dimensions when generating your bit vectors. For example, if you want to simulate the transmission of bits for multiple users, you can add an extra dimension for the users.\n\n```python\nnum_users = 5\nb = binary_source([batch_size, num_users, k_ldpc])\n```\n\n7. You can then process these multi-dimensional tensors in the same way as before. The Sionna package will automatically handle the extra dimensions.\n\nRemember that the first dimension is always used for batch parallelization, so each element in this dimension is simulated independently. This allows for efficient data flow and parallelization of simulations."}]}

It takes two inputs: the transmitter index (`tx_ind`) and the index of the stream (`tx_stream_ind`).\n\nKey properties included in PilotPattern class are:\n\n- `num_data_symbols`: Gives the number of data symbols per transmit stream. \n- `num_effective_subcarriers`: Gives the number of effective subcarriers.\n- `num_ofdm_symbols`: Gives the number of OFDM symbols.\n- `num_pilot_symbols`: Gives the number of pilot symbols per transmit stream.\n- `num_streams_per_tx`: Gives the number of streams per transmitter.\n- `num_tx`: Gives the number of transmitters.\n- `mask`: Gives the mask of the pilot pattern.\n- `normalize`: A flag that indicates if the pilots are normalized or not.\n- `trainable`: A flag that indicates if the pilots are trainable or not.\n\nSpecific classes like `EmptyPilotPattern` and `KroneckerPilotPattern` generate specific pilot patterns. `EmptyPilotPattern` class generates a PilotPattern with an empty mask and pilots, while `KroneckerPilotPattern` automatically generates orthogonal pilot transmissions for all transmitters and streams.\n\nTo visualize the pilot patterns of some transmitter and streams, you can use the `.show()` method of the PilotPattern class. For example:\n\n```python\npilotpattern_instance = PilotPattern(mask, pilots)\npilotpattern_instance.show(tx_ind, tx_stream_ind)\n```\nThis method will return a matplot figure object that depicts the pilot patterns for a specific transmitter and stream."}]}

The decoder takes logits or log-likelihood ratios (LLR) of the received code bits as input. The decoding process is iterative, and each iteration involves passing messages within a graph that represents the Polar code structure.\n\nTo decode with PolarBPDecoder, you would initialize an instance of the class with parameters including the indices of the frozen positions (`frozen_pos`), the codeword length (`n`), the number of iterations (`num_iter`), a flag indicating whether to provide hard-decided information bits (`hard_out`), and the output data type (`output_dtype`).\n\nHere's a snippet to illustrate the decoder setup in Python, using the Sionna API:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.decoding import PolarBPDecoder\nimport tensorflow as tf\n# Assume frozen_pos is an array of indices for frozen positions\n# and n is the codeword length.\nbp_decoder = PolarBPDecoder(frozen_pos=frozen_pos, n=n, num_iter=20, hard_out=True, output_dtype=tf.float32)\n```\n\nWhen you feed the decoder logits/llr values for a received codeword, you'll receive the estimated information bits:\n\n```python\n# Assuming llr is a tensor containing the channel LLR values\ndecoded_bits = bp_decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe output format of `decoded_bits` depends on the `hard_out` parameter:\n\n- If `hard_out=True`, the decoder outputs a tensor of hard-decided information bits. In this case, the output tensor will contain binary values (e.g., `[0, 1, 1, 0, ...]`), representing the estimated data after the decoding process.\n  \n- If `hard_out=False`, the decoder outputs a tensor of soft estimates (LLR values) for each information bit. The output tensor will contain floating-point values that indicate the likelihood of each bit being a `0` or `1`.\n\nPlease note that when using this API, you should have access to the correct frozen positions (`frozen_pos`) and codeword length (`n`). They must be determined according to the Polar code construction method you are employing, and they need to match the code parameters. Additionally, the code examples given here serve as general guidelines and require actual `frozen_pos` and `llr` values to be provided for execution.\n\nAlso, the actual performance and results of decoding with PolarBPDecoder are highly dependent on the quality of the received LLR values and the number of iterations specified. More iterations generally lead to better decoding performance at the cost of increased computational complexity."}]}

Based on the provided context information about the `TurboEncoder` class, we can initialize the encoder in Python as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.turbo import TurboEncoder\n\n# Initialize TurboEncoder with a constraint length of 4\nencoder = TurboEncoder(constraint_length=4, # Desired constraint length of the polynomials\n                       rate=1/3,  # Desired rate of Turbo code, assuming we want a rate of 1/3\n                       terminate=True)  # Terminate the constituent convolutional encoders to all-zero state, assuming we want to terminate the encoder\n```\n\nRegarding the termination of the encoder to an all-zero state, it does affect the actual code rate when `terminate=True`. The actual code rate will be slightly lower than the designated rate (`rate`) parameter of the `TurboEncoder`. The rate loss occurs because additional bits are needed to bring the encoder to an all-zero state, which is necessary for proper termination of the Turbo coding process.\n\nFor instance, as per the context provided, when `terminate=True`, the true rate of the Turbo code can be computed using the following formula:\n\n\\( \\frac{k}{\\frac{k}{r} + \\frac{4(\\mu-1)}{3r}} \\)\n\nWhere:\n- \\( k \\) is the number of information bits per codeword,\n- \\( r \\) denotes the design rate specified by `rate`,\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the `constraint_length`.\n\nIn the example provided, for the constraint length of 4 and termination option `True`, for the rate `1/3`, the actual rate would be lower than `1/3`. To get the true code rate, we substitute the values into the formula:\n\n\\( \\frac{k}{\\frac{k}{1/3} + \\frac{4(4-1)}{3(1/3)}} \\)\n\nSimplifying, we get the true rate as:\n\n\\( \\frac{k}{3k + 12} \\)\n\nSo, in conclusion, specifying `terminate=True` when creating an instance of `TurboEncoder` results in a slight reduction in the actual code rate compared to the design rate due to the inclusion of termination bits."}]}

However, there are several general limitations that could apply to model interfaces:\n\n1.   Restricted Set of Models: The Channel model interface provides certain pre-defined models, such as Rayleigh Block Fading, Kronecker Model, PerColumnModel etc. However, it does not cater to all possible variations of wireless channel models. If a particular channel model isn't offered by the interface, it would need to be custom implemented. \n\n2.   Noise Additive: While the Channel model interface has an 'add_awgn' parameter to add additive white Gaussian noise, it does not support other types of noise or interference that may occur in a wireless channel.\n\n3.   Defaults: Some parameters have default settings which may not be suitable for every scenario. Users must ensure they properly configure the system to their requirements.\n\n4.   Non-flexible Assumptions: Models like OFDMChannel make assumptions such as the Channel Impulse Response being constant over the duration of an OFDM symbol, and there's no inter-symbol nor inter-carrier interference. These assumptions may not hold true in more complex or different kinds of systems.\n\n5.   Time-Invariance: Some channel models like the `RayleighBlockFading` are time-invariant, and might not be suitable to model channels where the channel characteristics change over time.\n\n6. Inclusion of Code: The limitations of the Channel model interface also extend to limitations present in the code its based on. Issues with the code can directly lead to issues with the model interface.\n\n7. Limited Support for MIMO Links: in applying single tap frequency responses to channel inputs, each antenna of each receiver computes the channel output by summing over all the antennas of all transmitters. However, this may only cover certain types of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) links and not all possible MIMO scenarios.\n\nKindly note, these points are interpretations made from the given context and may not cover all the possible limitations of the Channel model interface."}]}

This happens because these scramblers are stateless - their internal seed does not update on runtime and therefore, it does not change after initialization.\n\nTo use Scrambler and Descrambler in your code, you first create an instance of Scrambler by providing the seed and indicating whether you want to flip bits. \n\nHere is a python code snippet for this:\n```python\nscrambler = Scrambler(seed=1234, binary=True)\n```\n\nNext, you connect this Scrambler instance to Descrambler as follows:\n```python\ndescrambler = Descrambler(scrambler=scrambler)\n```\nOnce your Scrambler and Descrambler are set up, you can scramble a given binary sequence `c` by calling `c_scr = scrambler(c)`. This will use the Scrambler instance to flip bits in the `c` sequence. \n\nTo then descramble `c_scr` and get back your original sequence `c`, you call `c_descr = descrambler(c_scr)`. This utilizes the previously defined Descrambler instance. \n\nThe Sionna package also provides `TB5GScrambler` for 5G NR compliant scrambling.\n\nPlease take note that in both scrambling and descrambling sequences, assertions and exceptions are part of the error-checking mechanism to ensure the correct type and value of seeds as well as other related parameters. \n\nUltimately, the application of Scrambler and Descrambler modules within the Sionna package plays an essential role in manipulating sequences, especially in scenarios such as distributed graph execution or ensuring equal bit probabilities in certain simulations."}]}

Import the necessary classes from the Sionna package using the provided APIs:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.linear import LinearEncoder, OSDecoder\n```\n\n2. Create an instance of `LinearEncoder`, ensuring that it is properly initialized with either a generator or a parity-check matrix.

In this region, the electromagnetic field of the antenna is typically planar, and the power density of the signal decreases as the square of the distance from the antenna.\n\nThe far field can be described mathematically using the concept of a spherical wave originating from the center of the antenna. The electric far field of an antenna in free space can be represented as:\n\nE(r, \u03b8, \u03c6, t) = E0(\u03b8, \u03c6) e^(j\u03c9t) e^(-jk0r) / r\n\nwhere E0(\u03b8, \u03c6) is the electric field phasor, r is the distance (or radius), \u03b8 is the zenith angle, and \u03c6 is the azimuth angle. The field strength decays as 1/r, differentiating it from a planar wave.\n\nThe complex antenna field pattern F(\u03b8, \u03c6) is defined as the electric field phasor normalized by its maximum value. This pattern provides a measure of how the power radiated by the antenna varies with direction.\n\nThe time-averaged Poynting vector, which describes the directional energy flux (energy transfer per unit area per unit time), is given by:\n\nS(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = 1/(2Z0) |E(r, \u03b8, \u03c6)|^2 r\u0302\n\nwhere Z0 is the wave impedance.\n\nThe received power at a receiving antenna can be calculated using the Friis transmission equation, which takes into account the gain of the transmitting and receiving antennas, the distance between them, and the wavelength of the signal."}]}

If this product is even, a value of one will be added.\n\nThe filter is applied through discrete convolution.\n\nAn optional windowing function window can be applied to the filter.\n\nThe dtype of the output is tf.float if both x and the filter coefficients have dtype tf.float. Otherwise, the dtype of the output is tf.complex.\n\nThree padding modes are available for applying the filter:\n- \u201cfull\u201d (default): Returns the convolution at each point of overlap between x and the filter. The length of the output is N + K - 1. Zero-padding of the input x is performed to compute the convolution at the borders.\n- \u201csame\u201d: Returns an output of the same length as the input x. The convolution is computed such that the coefficients of the input x are centered on the coefficient of the filter with index (K-1)/2. Zero-padding of the input signal is performed to compute the convolution at the borders.\n- \u201cvalid\u201d: Returns the convolution only at points where x and the filter completely overlap.

Defaults to \"full\".\n- `conjugate` (bool): If True, the complex conjugate of the filter is applied. Defaults to False.\n\n### Output\n\n- `y` ([..., M], tf.complex or tf.float): Filtered input. It is tf.float only if both x and the filter are tf.float. It is tf.complex otherwise. The length M depends on the padding.\n\n### Properties\n\n**Property: `aclr`**\n- ACLR of the filter. This corresponds to using the filter as a pulse shaping filter on an i.i.d. sequence of symbols, with the in-band assumed to range from [-0.5, 0.5] in normalized frequency.\n\n**Property: `beta`**\n- Roll-off factor.\n\n**Property: `coefficients`**\n- The filter coefficients (after normalization).\n\n**Property: `length`**\n- The filter length in samples.\n\n**Property: `normalize`**\n- True if the filter is normalized to have unit power.\n\n**Property: `sampling_times`**\n- Sampling times in multiples of the symbol duration.\n\n**Property: `trainable`**\n- True if the filter coefficients are trainable.\n\n**Property: `window`**\n- The window function applied to the filter coefficients. None if no window is applied.\n\n### Method: `show(response='impulse', scale='lin')`\n\nPlot the impulse or magnitude response\n\nPlots the impulse response (time domain) or magnitude response (frequency domain) of the filter.\n\nFor the computation of the magnitude response, a minimum DFT size of 1024 is assumed which is obtained through zero padding of the filter coefficients in the time domain.\n\n- **Input**:\n  - `response` (str, one of [\"impulse\", \"magnitude\"]): Desired response type. Defaults to \u201cimpulse\u201d.\n  - `scale` (str, one of [\"lin\", \"db\"]): Y-scale of the magnitude response. Can be \"lin\" (linear) or \"db\" (decibel). Defaults to \"lin\"."}]}

The BP decoder should be set to be stateful and trainable, with the number of iterations set to 1. This allows the decoder to perform a single iteration and return its current estimate while also providing the internal messages for the next iteration.\n\n2. **Initialize the Model**: Initialize the model with the parity-check matrix of the code under investigation and the number of BP decoding iterations.\n\n3. **Train the Model**: Train the model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). During training, call the model with a batch size and an SNR value. The model should generate Gaussian LLRs and perform BP decoding iteration-wise. The loss should be calculated after each iteration and averaged over all iterations.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Model**: After training, evaluate the model's performance by simulating its Bit Error Rate (BER) performance.\n\n5. **Apply Damping**: To apply the concept of damped BP, calculate the mean value of the weights of the trained model and set all weights to this constant scaling factor. This is equivalent to scaling all messages with the same scalar, which can help improve the performance of BP decoding.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Damped Model**: Finally, evaluate the performance of the damped model by simulating its BER performance and comparing it to the performance of the untrained model.\n\nPlease note that the provided context includes Python code that uses the Sionna library to implement these steps.

This path can involve various phenomena such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and scattering, which can alter the signal's direction, amplitude, and phase.\n\nThe propagation path can be represented by a single matrix, often referred to as the transfer matrix. This matrix encapsulates all the transformations that the signal undergoes along its propagation path. For instance, if the signal encounters a reflection, the transfer matrix would include a reflection matrix that models this event. Similarly, if the signal undergoes diffraction, the transfer matrix would incorporate a diffraction matrix.\n\nThe transfer matrix is a powerful tool as it allows us to predict the signal's characteristics at the receiving antenna based on its initial properties at the transmitting antenna. By multiplying the signal's initial state vector (which describes its amplitude, phase, and direction) with the transfer matrix, we can obtain the state vector of the signal at the receiving antenna.\n\nIn the context provided, the transfer matrix is denoted as $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{T}}$ and is used to represent the cascade of scattering processes that the radiated field $\\mathbf{E}_\\text{T}(r, \\theta_\\text{T}, \\varphi_\\text{T})$ undergoes until it reaches the receiving antenna.

The equation used here is `rx_tx_association[i,j] = 1` which means that transmitter j sends one or multiple streams to receiver i.\n\n2. List2LLR: This abstract class defines a model to compute Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) from a list of candidate vectors provided by a MIMO detector. The underlying channel model assumed is `y_bar = R*x_bar + n_bar` where y_bar are the channel outputs, R is an upper-triangular matrix, x_bar is the transmitted vector drawn from the constellation, and n_bar is the white noise. It is assumed that a MIMO detector produces K candidate solutions `x_bar_k` and their associated distance metrics `d_k`.\n\n3.

The Kronecker model applies the same spatial correlation matrix to every antenna column, while the PerColumnModel allows different spatial correlation matrices for each antenna.\n\n5. **ChannelModel**: This is an abstract class for drawing channel impulse responses.\n\n6. **TimeChannel and OFDMChannel**: They are used to generate channel responses (either in time or frequency domain respectively) and apply these responses to a provided input.\n\n7. **RayleighBlockFading**: Generates channel impulse responses corresponding to a Rayleigh block fading channel model.

The purpose of this object is to work with transmitted streams of data and improve the accuracy of the data received.\n\nThis class takes several key parameters:\n\n- **output**: The type of output, either bits or symbols.\n- **num_streams**: The number of transmitted streams.\n- **k**: The number of paths to keep.\n- **constellation_type**: The type of constellation applied, if not custom.\n- **num_bits_per_symbol**: The number of bits per constellation symbol, for example, 4 for QAM16.\n- **constellation**: An instance of `Constellation` or `None`.\n- **hard_out**: Boolean to decide if the detector computes hard-decided bit values or constellation point indices instead of soft-values.\n- **dtype**: The type of data being dealt with \u2013 either complex64 or complex128.\n\nFurthermore, this class contains the functionality for configuring which transmitter is sending what data stream to the receiver. It can be used to manage streams in multi-cell MIMO networks and explicitly represents the association between receivers, transmitters, and the streams they handle.\n\nThe function of the `KBestDetector` includes processes like handling interference, managing detections, and performing error correction, and K-Best detection operates under certain symmetry constraints on the receiver-transmitter association.\n\nOn running the detector, you will receive an output of either:\n\n- LLRs or hard-decisions for every bit of every stream if 'output' equals 'bit'.\n- Logits or hard-decisions for constellation symbols for every stream if 'output' equals 'symbol'.\n\nNote: The use of this class in Graph mode with XLA could potentially raise compatibility issues, and an adjustment to `sionna.Config.xla_compat` may be necessary."}]}

Further, puncturing to attain a rate-1/2 Turbo code is supported.\n\nThe class inherits from the Keras layer class and can be used as layer in a Keras model.  \n  \n**Note: **Various notations are used in literature to represent the generator polynomials for convolutional codes. For simplicity TurboEncoder only accepts the binary format, i.e., 10011, for the gen_poly argument which corresponds to the polynomial $1 + D^3 + D^4$.  \n  \nNote that Turbo codes require the underlying convolutional encoders to be recursive systematic encoders. Only then the channel output from the systematic part of the first encoder can be used to decode the second encoder.\n\nAlso note that constraint_length and memory are two different terms often used to denote the strength of the convolutional code. In this sub-package we use constraint_length. For example, the polynomial 10011 has a constraint_length of 5, however its memory is only 4.  \n  \nWhen terminate is True, the true rate of the Turbo code is slightly lower than rate.

Hereby, ``codeword_index`` corresponds to the\n    index of the codeword to be scrambled.\n\n    If ``n_rnti`` are a list of ints, the scrambler assumes that the second\n    last axis contains `len(` ``n_rnti`` `)` elements.

In the `__init__` method of this class, you can specify the detection method to be used.

Depending on the value of this parameter, a different detector is used in the model. The `call` method should then be implemented to define the forward pass of the model.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified example and you would need to fill in the details based on your specific requirements.

This is usually done by evaluating both models on the same dataset and comparing their performance metrics. \n\nIn the given context, the untrained model is a neural network-based demapper and the baseline model is a conventional demapper. The performance of both models is evaluated using Bit Error Rate (BER) and Block Error Rate (BLER) as performance metrics. The models are evaluated over a range of Eb/N0 values (signal-to-noise ratio), and the number of bit errors and block errors are recorded for each value.\n\nHere is the relevant code snippet from the context:\n\n```python\n# Benchmarking\nbaseline = Baseline()\nmodel = End2EndSystem(False)\nber_plots = sn.utils.PlotBER(\"Neural Demapper\")\nber_plots.simulate(baseline,\n                  ebno_dbs=np.linspace(EBN0_DB_MIN, EBN0_DB_MAX, 20),\n                  batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,\n                  num_target_block_errors=100, # simulate until 100 block errors occured\n                  legend=\"Baseline\",\n                  soft_estimates=True,\n                  max_mc_iter=100, # run 100 Monte-Carlo simulations (each with batch_size samples)\n                  show_fig=False);\nber_plots.simulate(model,\n                  ebno_dbs=np.linspace(EBN0_DB_MIN, EBN0_DB_MAX, 20),\n                  batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,\n                  num_target_block_errors=100, # simulate until 100 block errors occured\n                  legend=\"Untrained model\",\n                  soft_estimates=True,\n                  max_mc_iter=100, # run 100 Monte-Carlo simulations (each with batch_size samples)\n                  show_fig=True);\n```\n\nIn this code, the `simulate` method from `sn.utils.PlotBER` is used to evaluate the models and plot the BER. The `baseline` and `model` are instances of the baseline and untrained models respectively. The `ebno_dbs` parameter specifies the range of Eb/N0 values to evaluate the models on. The `batch_size` parameter specifies the number of examples to process in parallel. The `num_target_block_errors` parameter specifies the number of block errors to simulate until. The `legend` parameter is used to label the models in the plot. The `soft_estimates` parameter is set to `True` to indicate that the models return soft estimates. The `max_mc_iter` parameter specifies the maximum number of Monte-Carlo simulations to run. The `show_fig` parameter is used to control whether to display the plot after simulation."}]}

For a single pair of antennas,\n    the received signal sequence is given as:\n\n    .. math::\n\n        y_b = \\sum_{\\ell =L_\\text{min}}^{L_\\text{max}} \\bar{h}_\\ell x_{b-\\ell} + w_b, \\quad b \\in[L_\\text{min}, N_B+L_\\text{max}-1]\n\n    where :math:`\\bar{h}_\\ell` are the discrete-time channel taps,\n    :math:`x_{b}` is the the transmitted signal,\n    and :math:`w_\\ell` Gaussian noise.\n\n    Starting from the first symbol, the demodulator cuts the input\n    sequence into pieces of size ``cyclic_prefix_length + fft_size``,\n    and throws away any trailing symbols.

Turbo code decoding is based on the iterative exchange of soft information between two constituent convolutional decoders arranged in parallel. The `BCJRDecoder` is known for implementing the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) algorithm (or the simplified Max-Log-MAP approximation) for decoding convolutional codes\u2014a vital component of Turbo code decoding.\n\nWhen initializing a `TurboDecoder` instance, we can pass it a reference to a pre-existing `TurboEncoder` object or provide necessary parameters such as generator polynomials (`gen_poly`), the rate of the Turbo code (`rate`), constraint length (`constraint_length`), etc., as shown in the given context:\n\n```python\ndecoder = TurboDecoder(encoder,\n                       num_iter=6,  # Number of iterations between component BCJR decoders\n                       algorithm=\"map\",  # can be also \"maxlog\"\n                       hard_out=True)  # hard_decide output\n```\n\nHere, `encoder` is a previously created instance of `TurboEncoder`, `num_iter` specifies the number of turbo decoding iterations to perform, `algorithm` denotes which MAP algorithm variant to use, and `hard_out` indicates whether the decoder's output should be hard-bit decisions or soft-decision log-likelihood ratios (LLRs).\n\nDuring the decoding process, the `TurboDecoder` computes LLRs using two component `BCJRDecoder` layers that correspond to the two underlying convolutional codes of the Turbo code. The decoder alternates between these two decoders, exchanging soft information (extrinsic information) between them during each iteration to improve the reliability of the bit estimates.\n\nThe input LLRs for the `TurboDecoder` come from a demodulator (de-mapper), representing the likelihood of received symbols. The decoded output is either an estimate of the bit sequence (if `hard_out` is `True`) or updated LLRs, which can be converted to bit estimates after all iterations have completed.\n\nThe specific use of the `BCJRDecoder` layers is not detailed explicitly in the provided context. However, it can be surmised that two instances of the `BCJRDecoder` are created and invoked in an iterative process to achieve the final decoded output in the `TurboDecoder`. If you need exact details on how the `BCJRDecoder` layers are used within the `TurboDecoder`, you would need to refer to the source code or documentation of the Sionna library, which is beyond the scope of the given context."}]}

This process is essential for ensuring that the iterative decoding algorithm used in Turbo codes can properly finish without error propagation from the end of the codeword.\n\nThe `term_bits_turbo2conv` and `termbits_conv2turbo` methods within the `TurboTermination` class manage the conversion of termination bits between the Turbo codeword format and the constituent convolutional encoders' termination formats.\n\n1. **`term_bits_turbo2conv` Method**:\nThis method takes as input the termination bits from a Turbo codeword and splits them into two sets of termination bits, each corresponding to one of the two constituent convolutional encoders used in the Turbo code. These termination bits are necessary for properly terminating the recursive convolutional encoders that make up the Turbo code.\n\nInput format:\n- `term_bits`: A tensor of type `tf.float32` containing the termination part of the Turbo codeword channel symbols.\n\nOutput:\n- The output is a tuple of two tensors of type `tf.float32`. Each tensor contains the termination bits for one of the convolutional encoders and has shape `[mu, 2]`, where `mu` is the memory of the convolutional encoder.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.turbo import TurboTermination\n\n# Assuming turbo_term is a tensor with Turbo termination bits\nturbo_termination = TurboTermination(constraint_length=5)  # example constraint length\nconv_term1, conv_term2 = turbo_termination.term_bits_turbo2conv(turbo_term) # choose your own turbo_term\n```\n\n2. **`termbits_conv2turbo` Method**:\nThis method performs the inverse operation of `term_bits_turbo2conv`. It takes two sets of termination bits corresponding to the two convolutional encoders and merges them into a single tensor representing the termination bits for a Turbo codeword. Zero-padding may be added to ensure the length of the output is compatible with the Turbo codeword format.\n\nInput format:\n- `term_bits1`: A 2+D tensor of type `tf.int32` containing the termination bits from the first convolutional encoder.\n- `term_bits2`: A 2+D tensor of type `tf.int32` containing the termination bits from the second convolutional encoder.\n\nOutput:\n- A single 1+D tensor of type `tf.int32` that combines the termination bits from both encoders, with zero-padding included if necessary.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# conv_term1 and conv_term2 are tensors with termination bits from the convolutional encoders\nturbo_term = turbo_termination.termbits_conv2turbo(conv_term1, conv_term2)\n```\n\nIn practice, whenever using these methods, you need to ensure compatibility between the tensor shapes and types as per the requirements. Furthermore, always verify the integrity and validity of the tensors being transformed to avoid errors or mismatches in the encoding/decoding processes.\n\nIt should be noted that the code examples above assume you have the appropriate termination bit tensors already defined (like `turbo_term`, `conv_term1`, and `conv_term2`). These bits typically result from encoding or decoding procedures that are not shown in this explanation. The tensors are also not instantiated with actual data since that would require additional context from the code that generates or processes Turbo codewords and their associated termination symbols."}]}

This input must be of type `tf.float32`. Depending on the `method` parameter, the input symbols can be either LLR values or hard binary decisions.\n\n### Significance of the `method` Parameter\n\nThe `method` parameter in `ViterbiDecoder` is crucial because it specifies the type of input that the decoder expects and, in turn, the type of path metric computations performed:\n\n- If `method='soft_llr'` is used, input to the decoder should be Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs), representing the soft information from a demodulator.\n\n- If `method='hard'` is employed, the input is expected to be hard-decided symbols (binary values 0 or 1), which represents the scenario where a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) is assumed, and the input values will be quantized to 0 or 1.\n\nThe method used will affect the internal computations within the Viterbi algorithm and potentially the decoding performance, where typically `soft_llr` provides better performance due to utilizing soft information.\n\n### Format of the Output Tensor\n\nThe output from the `ViterbiDecoder` is a hard decided estimation of the information bits, which is a 2+D tensor with the shape `[..., k]`, where `k` is the number of information bits per codeword. The output type is determined by the `output_dtype` parameter, which defaults to `tf.float32`, and represents a hard decision on the estimated transmitted information bits.\n\n### Code Snippet for Reference\n\nHere is how you set up and use the `ViterbiDecoder` (assuming you have already created a `ConvEncoder`):\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.conv import ConvEncoder, ViterbiDecoder\n\n# Set up an encoder instance (already created for this example)\nencoder = ConvEncoder(rate=1/2, constraint_length=3)\n\n# Set up a corresponding ViterbiDecoder instance using the same configuration\ndecoder = ViterbiDecoder(encoder=encoder, method='soft_llr')\n\n# Assuming y is your noisy codeword tensor with shape [..., n]\n# u_hat will contain the estimated information bits with shape [..., k]\nu_hat = decoder(y)\n```\n\nTo reiterate, it is essential to ensure that the input to the `ViterbiDecoder` matches the format expected based on the `method` parameter specified, and the output will be a tensor with estimates of the information bits."}]}

It is characterized by the bending of waves around the corners of an obstacle or aperture into the region of geometrical shadow of the obstacle. In classical physics, this effect was first described by Huygens' principle, later by Fresnel and Kirchhoff integrals, and most famously by the double-slit experiment in optics.\n\nIncorporating diffraction into geometrical optics involves considering the wave nature of light. Geometrical optics, which is often referred to as ray optics, treats light as a collection of rays that travel in straight lines and bend when they pass through or reflect from surfaces. It is a simplification of the true nature of light, which is a wave phenomenon, but it is very useful for understanding how lenses and mirrors work.\n\nHowever, geometrical optics fails to accurately describe phenomena such as diffraction and interference, which occur when light passes through small openings or around sharp edges, or when multiple light waves overlap. These phenomena can only be explained by considering the wave nature of light.\n\nTo incorporate diffraction into geometrical optics, one can use the principles of wave optics or physical optics, which take into account the wave nature of light. This involves understanding the superposition of waves, the concept of phase and coherence, and the use of the Huygens-Fresnel principle or the Kirchhoff diffraction formula to calculate the amplitude of a diffracted wave.\n\nIn the context provided, the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) is mentioned, which is a method that allows the incorporation of diffraction into geometrical optics. It provides solutions that are uniformly valid, even at shadow boundaries. The UTD is used to calculate the diffraction coefficients for the fields diffracted by an edge or a corner. These coefficients are then used to calculate the fields at the receiving antenna, taking into account both the direct path and the paths involving diffraction from the edges or corners of the objects in the environment."}]}

Also, import utilities for computing bit error rate (BER), converting Eb/No to noise variance, and simulating BER. If you're using TensorFlow, configure the GPU settings if necessary.\n\n2. **Configure the PUSCH**: Create a PUSCH configuration with the desired settings. This includes the carrier configuration, DMRS configuration, and transport block configuration. You can modify these configurations to simulate different scenarios.\n\n3. **Create the PUSCH Transmitter and Receiver**: Instantiate a PUSCHTransmitter and PUSCHReceiver using the PUSCHConfig. If you want to simulate multiple transmitters, you can create multiple PUSCHConfigs and instantiate a PUSCHTransmitter with a list of these configurations.\n\n4. **Set up the channel**: Choose the channel model you want to simulate. This could be an AWGN channel, a Rayleigh block fading channel, or any other model. You can also set up a multi-antenna system using the AntennaArray class.\n\n5. **Simulate transmissions**: Generate a batch of transmit signals and information bits using the PUSCHTransmitter. Simulate the channel output by passing the transmit signal and noise variance to the channel model. Recover the information bits using the PUSCHReceiver.\n\n6. **Compute the BER**: Use the compute_ber function to calculate the bit error rate. This gives you a measure of the performance of the system.\n\n7. **Repeat for different detectors and CSI conditions**: Repeat the above steps for different MIMO detectors (like KBestDetector or LinearDetector) and different CSI conditions (perfect or estimated). This allows you to compare the performance under different conditions.\n\n8. **Analyze the results**: Compare the BER for different detectors and CSI conditions.

It combines modulation and coding into two individual tasks, which simplifies the engineering process.

The uncoded information bits are first passed through a channel encoder to generate codeword bits.\n2. These codeword bits are then interleaved to break local dependencies and ensure that the channel decoder effectively sees one channel.\n3. The interleaved bits are then mapped to complex-valued symbols using a mapper.\n4. These symbols are transmitted over a noisy channel, and the received noisy symbols are demapped back to bit-wise Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n5. The LLRs are deinterleaved and then passed through a channel decoder to estimate the original information bits.\n\nIn the Sionna Python package, BICM is implemented using various components such as the Mapper, Demapper, LDPC5GEncoder, LDPC5GDecoder, AWGN channel, BinarySource, GaussianPriorSource, Interleaver, Deinterleaver, Scrambler, and Descrambler. These components are used to simulate the BICM system and analyze its performance in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) and Block Error Rate (BLER) over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel.\n\nThe Sionna package also provides functionalities to simulate the BER of the BICM system including LDPC codes, simulate the BER with all-zero codeword transmission, approximate the LLR distribution of the all-zero codeword, and analyze the convergence behavior of iterative receivers using Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts."}]}

Here are the steps:\n\n1. First, create transmit and receive correlation matrices. You can use the `exp_corr_mat` function for this. The function takes two parameters: the correlation factor and the number of antennas. For example, if you have 4 transmit antennas and the correlation factor is 0.4, you can create the transmit correlation matrix as follows:\n\n```python\nr_tx = exp_corr_mat(0.4, num_tx_ant)\n```\n\n2. Similarly, create the receive correlation matrix. If you have 16 receive antennas and the correlation factor is 0.9, you can create the receive correlation matrix as follows:\n\n```python\nr_rx = exp_corr_mat(0.9, num_rx_ant)\n```\n\n3. Next, add the spatial correlation model to the channel. You can use the `KroneckerModel` for this. The `KroneckerModel` takes two parameters: the transmit and receive correlation matrices. Here is how you can add the spatial correlation model to the channel:\n\n```python\nchannel.spatial_corr = KroneckerModel(r_tx, r_rx)\n```\n\n4. Now, you can transmit the symbols over the channel with spatial correlation and compute the SER (Symbol Error Rate). Here is an example:\n\n```python\ny, h = channel([x, no])\nx_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s)\nx_ind_hat = symbol_demapper([x_hat, no])\ncompute_ser(x_ind, x_ind_hat)\n```\n\nIn this example, `x` is the batch of random transmit vectors of random 16QAM symbols, `no` is the noise variance of the channel, and `s` is the noise covariance matrix. The `lmmse_equalizer` function is used to compute soft-symbols, and the `symbol_demapper` function is used to make hard decisions on the symbols. The `compute_ser` function is then used to compute the SER."}]}

OSD is designed to provide near-maximum likelihood (ML) decoding performance, assuming the order of the decoder, denoted as `t`, is sufficiently large. The trade-off here is between the high computational complexity associated with OSD and the quality of the ML estimation it can achieve.\n\nIn terms of computational complexity, the OSD algorithm is noted for its high demand on computational resources. This largely stems from the steps involved in the OSD process, which include:\n\n1. Sorting log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) by reliability and permuting the generator or parity-check matrix accordingly.\n2. Transforming the permuted matrix into a systematic form, known as the \"most-reliable basis.\"\n3. Hard-deciding and re-encoding of the most reliable bits while discarding the less reliable received positions.\n4. Generating all possible error patterns up to `t` errors in the most reliable positions and finding the most likely codeword within these candidates.\n\nThe complexity rises exponentially with the increase in the order `t` of the OSD algorithm because ${n \\choose t}$ error patterns need to be evaluated, where `n` is the length of the codeword. Therefore, the higher the value of `t`, the larger the number of error patterns that must be considered, which can render the decoding process computationally infeasible, especially for codes with longer lengths.\n\nOn the other hand, the quality of the ML estimation that OSD can achieve is directly related to the order `t`. A higher value of `t` increases the chances that the correct error pattern will be among those evaluated, thus improving the accuracy of the decoding and bringing it closer to true ML performance. However, balancing this potential for high-quality decoding against the practical limitations imposed by computational complexity is a significant challenge.\n\nIn practice, the Sionna package suggests that while OSD (`OSDecoder` class) can be used for arbitrary linear block codes and provides an avenue to estimate the expected ML performance for larger values of `t`, it is only feasible for small code lengths or low orders of `t`. For specific families of codes, alternative decoding algorithms may offer near-ML performance with lesser complexity, such as the `ViterbiDecoder` for convolutional codes or the `PolarSCLDecoder` for Polar codes when using a sufficiently large list size.\n\nTo demonstrate how to set up an `OSDecoder` using Sionna APIs, one would use the following:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sionna.fec.linear import OSDecoder\n\n# Define a parity-check matrix for a (7,4) Hamming code\npcm = np.array([[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n                [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n                [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]])\n\n\n# Initialize the decoder with the parity-check matrix and the order of the OSD\ndecoder = OSDecoder(pcm, t=4, is_pcm=True)\n```\n\nThe trade-off between computational complexity and ML estimation quality with OSD is a key consideration in choosing the appropriate decoding strategy. Researchers and practitioners must carefully evaluate the requirements of their specific application, such as code length and acceptable decoding latency, when deciding on the use of OSD or alternative decoding methods."}]}

The J-function relates mutual information to the mean of Gaussian distributed Log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), which is a measure used in the process of decoding received messages. The J-function is an approximation proposed in the work referenced in the provided context as [Brannstrom].\n\nThe \"j_fun_tf\" function takes two input parameters. The first one, `mu`, is a tensor of arbitrary shape containing the mean values of LLRs. The second input, `verify_inputs`, is a boolean flag that defaults to True. If `verify_inputs` is set to True, the `mu` parameter is internally clipped to be numerical stable.\n\nThe function assumes that `mu` is a tensor of non-negative floats and raises an `InvalidArgumentError` if `mu` is negative. It returns a tensor of the same shape and datatype as `mu`, which contains the approximated value of the mutual information. By calculating the J-function, it indirectly gives an estimate of the quality of the decoded messages in a communication process, which is typically a vital concern in areas like telecommunications and data transmission.\n\nPlease note that no code snippet calling \"j_fun_tf\" is directly provided in the provided context. However, calling it would typically look like this:\n\n```python\nresult = j_fun_tf(mu_tensor, verify_inputs=True)\n```\n\nWhere `mu_tensor` would be a TensorFlow tensor containing the LLR means you want to process."}]}

Import the necessary classes from the Sionna package:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.linear import LinearEncoder\nfrom sionna.fec.linear import OSDecoder\n```\n\n2. Load or define a parity-check matrix (PCM) or generator matrix (GM) corresponding to the block code you wish to simulate. The PCM must be binary and of full rank to work with `LinearEncoder`. As per the context, you can load an example code or import an external parity-check matrix in alist format and convert it:\n\n```python\n# Either load an example PCM\npcm, k, n, coderate = load_parity_check_examples(pcm_id=1)\n\n# Or import an external parity-check matrix in alist format\n# and convert it to PCM (assuming you have a filename variable with the path)\nal = load_alist(path=filename)\npcm, k, n, coderate = alist2mat(al)\n```\n\n3. Initialize the `LinearEncoder` with the parity-check or generator matrix. If you have a parity-check matrix, indicate that by setting the `is_pcm` flag to `True`.\n\n```python\nencoder = LinearEncoder(enc_mat=pcm, is_pcm=True)\n```\n\n4. Initialize the `OSDecoder`. You can either directly supply it with the generator matrix or parity-check matrix, or you can initialize it with the instance of `LinearEncoder` you created previously. You also need to specify the order `t` of the OSD, which influences the decoding complexity and performance.\n\n```python\n# If supplying the PCM directly\ndecoder = OSDecoder(pcm, t=4, is_pcm=True)\n\n# Or, using the encoder instance\ndecoder = OSDecoder(encoder=encoder, t=4)\n```\n\n5. Encode the information bits using the `encoder`. Ensure the input tensor `u` contains the information bits with the shape `[..., k]`, where `k` is the number of information bits per codeword.\n\n```python\nc = encoder(u)\n```\n\n6. After the encoded bits are transmitted through a channel and received, compute the Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) for the received bits. Let's assume this LLR calculation is performed by a function (not shown in the context) and results in a tensor `llr_ch` with the shape `[..., n]`, which corresponds to the LLRs of the received bits.\n\n7. Decode the received LLRs using the `OSDecoder` to retrieve the estimated original codeword:\n\n```python\nc_hat = decoder(llr_ch)\n```\n\n8. (Optional) Compare the decoded codeword `c_hat` with the transmitted codeword `c` to evaluate the performance of the code and the decoder.\n\nPlease note that in this explanation, the functions `load_parity_check_examples`, `load_alist`, and `alist2mat` are placeholders for whichever appropriate functions you would be using to load or convert your code matrices. You would need to replace these with the actual functions from your working environment or simulation setup.\n\nAdditionally, the steps involving the actual transmission of the encoded bits through a channel and the calculation of LLRs were not detailed in the context, and they depend on the specific channel model and modulation scheme in use. It's essential to implement these steps correctly for a meaningful simulation. \n\nWhen implementing this pipeline, make sure the actual code, dimensions of the tensors, and other parameters fit your specific simulation context.

Turbo codes are a class of high-performance error correction codes developed by Berrou, Glavieux, and Thitimajshima in 1993. They are notable for coming close to the Shannon limit, which is the maximum possible efficiency of error correction coding. \n\nThe `TurboEncoder` class in Sionna specifically implements the standard Turbo code framework, which involves two identical rate-1/2 convolutional encoders that are combined to produce a rate-1/3 Turbo code. This encoder can also support puncturing to achieve a rate-1/2 Turbo code if required. Puncturing is a method used to effectively increase the code rate by intentionally omitting (or \"puncturing\") some of the encoded bits.\n\nIn the Sionna implementation, the `TurboEncoder` uses binary formatted generator polynomials to define the convolutional component encoders. The encoder also supports features like specifying the constraint length, the code rate, termination options, and the type of interleaver to use. The interleaver rearranges the input bits in a pseudo-random way before they are fed into the second convolutional encoder. The specific option '3GPP' refers to using the Turbo code interleaver from the 3GPP LTE standard.\n\nA usage example provided in the context shows how to set up the encoder with specific parameters, and how to encode information bits into a codeword. The `TurboEncoder` class is designed to work within the TensorFlow/Keras framework, allowing it to be integrated into machine learning models as a layer.\n\nThe described functionalities make the `TurboEncoder` a critical component in communication systems where error correction is necessary, specifically for Turbo codes that are used in standards like LTE."}]}

The pilots contains the pilot symbols that are transmitted at the positions indicated by the mask. Separating a pilot pattern into mask and pilots enables the implementation of a wide range of pilot configurations, including trainable pilot sequences.\n\nThe following code snippet shows how to define a simple custom PilotPattern for single transmitter, sending two streams Note that num_effective_subcarriers is the number of subcarriers that can be used for data or pilot transmissions.

Generate a batch of random transmit vectors of random 16QAM symbols using the `QAMSource` class. The number of transmit antennas (`num_tx_ant`) and the batch size are parameters for this operation.\n\n2. Create an instance of the `FlatFadingChannel` class to simulate transmissions over an i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel. The channel will also add AWGN with variance `no`. As we will need knowledge of the channel realizations for detection, we activate the `return_channel` flag.\n\n3. Transmit the symbols over the channel. The channel output and channel realizations are represented by `y` and `h` respectively.\n\n4. Implement an LMMSE equalizer to compute soft-symbols using the perfect channel knowledge. The noise covariance matrix in this example is just a scaled identity matrix which we need to provide to the `lmmse_equalizer`.\n\n5. Make hard decisions on the symbols and compute the SER. This is done using the `SymbolDemapper` class and the `compute_ser` function.\n\n6. If you want to add spatial correlation to the `FlatFadingChannel`, use the `SpatialCorrelation` class. You can setup a Kronecker (`KroneckerModel`) correlation model using exponential correlation matrices (`exp_corr_mat`).\n\n7. To extend to channel coding, generate random QAM symbols through mapping of coded bits. Reshaping is required to bring `x` into the needed shape. Transmit the symbols over the channel, demap the symbols to LLRs prior to decoding them. Note that you need to bring `x_hat` and `no_eff` back to the desired shape for decoding.\n\n8.

Instantiate different versions of this model and use the `PlotBer` class for easy Monte-Carlo simulations.\n\nRemember to import the necessary modules and classes from the Sionna package before starting."}]}

As the same pilot sequences are reused across those OFDM symbols, the resulting pilot pattern has a frequency-time Kronecker structure.

In higher order modulation, each received symbol contains information about multiple transmitted bits. The demapper produces bit-wise Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) estimates where each LLR contains information about an individual bit. This scheme allows a simple binary interface between demapper and decoder. \n\nHowever, the quality of the received LLRs depends on the bit index within a symbol. Further, LLRs may become correlated and each symbol error may lead to multiple erroneous received bits (mapped to the same symbol). The interleaver is introduced to break these local dependencies by rearranging the order of the bits between the channel coding and mapper (or demapper and decoder, respectively). \n\nFor sufficiently long codes, the channel decoder effectively sees one channel. This separation enables the simplified and elegant design of channel coding schemes based on binary bit-metric decoding. The interleaver ensures that the mapper/demapper operates on (pseudo-)random data, but from the decoder's perspective, the all-zero codeword assumption is still valid. This avoids the need for an actual encoder."}]}

It involves multiplying the filter coefficients by a window function, which is a real-valued vector of the same length as the filter. This operation is equivalent to a convolution of the filter and the window in the frequency domain.\n\nHere are the steps to use windowing to improve the spectral properties of a truncated filter:\n\n1. Create the filter: First, you need to create the filter that you want to improve. For example, you can create a root-raised-cosine filter with a roll-off factor of 0.22, spanning 32 symbols, with an oversampling factor of four.\n\n```python\nbeta = 0.22 # Roll-off factor\nspan_in_symbols = 32 # Filter span in symbols\nsamples_per_symbol = 4 # Number of samples per symbol, i.e., the oversampling factor\nrrcf = RootRaisedCosineFilter(span_in_symbols, samples_per_symbol, beta)\n```\n\n2. Apply the window function: Next, you need to apply the window function to the filter. This is done by creating a new filter with the same parameters as the original filter, but with an additional window parameter. The window parameter should be set to the name of the desired window function. For example, you can use the \"blackman\" window function.\n\n```python\nrrcf_windowed = RootRaisedCosineFilter(span_in_symbols, samples_per_symbol, beta, window=\"blackman\")\n```\n\n3. Compare the properties: Finally, you can compare the properties of the original filter and the windowed filter. You should see that the windowed filter has improved spectral properties, such as a reduced out-of-band attenuation. However, the passband of the filter may also be broadened, which could lead to an increased ACLR.\n\n```python\nrrcf.show(\"magnitude\", \"db\") # Show magnitude response of original filter\nrrcf_windowed.show(\"magnitude\", \"db\") # Show magnitude response of windowed filter\n```\n\nRemember that the choice of window function can have a significant impact on the spectral properties of the filter. Different window functions have different trade-offs, so you should choose the one that best meets your needs."}]}

For example:\n```python\nfrom sionna.channel.tr38901 import UMa\n\nchannel_model = UMa(carrier_frequency = 3.5e9,\n                    o2i_model = 'low',\n                    ut_array = ut_array,\n                    bs_array = bs_array,\n                    direction = 'uplink')\n```\nThe 'low' outdoor-to-indoor loss model is used in this case. \n\n4. Set up the network topology using `set_topology()` method. The topology parameters would include UTs and BSs locations, UTs velocities etc.\n```python\n# ut_loc ([batch size,num_ut, 3], tf.float) \u2013 Locations of the UTs\n# bs_loc ([batch size,num_bs, 3], tf.float) \u2013 Locations of BSs\n# ut_orientations ([batch size,num_ut, 3], tf.float) \u2013 Orientations of the UTs arrays \n# bs_orientations ([batch size,num_bs, 3], tf.float) \u2013 Orientations of the BSs arrays \n# ut_velocities ([batch size,num_ut, 3], tf.float) \u2013 Velocity vectors of UTs\n# in_state ([batch size,num_ut], tf.bool) \u2013 Indoor/outdoor state of UTs. True means indoor and False means outdoor.\n# los (tf.bool or None) \u2013 If not None (default value), all UTs located outdoor are forced to be in LoS if los is set to True, or in NLoS if it is set to False. If set to None, the LoS/NLoS states of UTs is set following 3GPP specification\nchannel_model.set_topology(ut_loc,\n                           bs_loc,\n                           ut_orientations,\n                           bs_orientations,\n                           ut_velocities,\n                           in_state,\n                           los)\n```\n\n5. Instantiate the OFDM channel with the instantiated channel model and an appropriate resource grid:\n```python\nfrom sionna.channel import OFDMChannel\n\nchannel = OFDMChannel(channel_model = channel_model,\n                      resource_grid = resource_grid)\n ```\nWhere `resource_grid` is an instance of the `ResourceGrid` class. \n\n6. Generate and apply the channel. Depending upon whether you want to use one go generation and application or separate processes for generation of channel responses and their application. \n\nIn case you want to generate and apply the channel in one go, you could use something like:\n```python\n# x is the channel input\n# no is the noise variance\ny = channel([x, no])\n```\n7. Finally, you can use the `show_topology()` method to display the network topology for the batch example. \n```python\n# bs_index, batch_index default to be 0\n# bs_index (int) \u2013 BS index with respect to which the LoS/NLoS state of UTs is indicated. Defaults to 0.\n# batch_index (int) \u2013 Batch example for which the topology is shown. Defaults to 0.\nchannel_model.show_topology(bs_index, batch_index)\n```\n\nAdjust these examples according to your specific configuration and scenario requirements. Furthermore, always ensure that the parameters are set according to the UMa model specification, the radio conditions and the network environment characteristics."}]}

For time-domain modeling, apply a perfect low-pass filter of the provided bandwidth to the continuous-time channel impulse response and then sample the filtered response at the Nyquist rate.\n\n6. **Other Physical Layer Components**: Finally, create instances of all other physical layer components needed for the simulation. These include the binary source, the encoder, the mapper, the resource grid mapper, the zero forcing precoder, the OFDM modulator and demodulator, the LS channel estimator, the LMMSE equalizer, the demapper, and the decoder.\n\nAfter configuring all components, you can simulate some simple transmissions in the time and frequency domain."}]}

When encoding is terminated, the encoder adds extra bits to the encoded sequence to bring the encoder's internal state back to the all-zero state. This practice is also known as \"tail-biting\" and ensures that the encoded sequence can be properly decoded starting from an all-zero state assumption, which can improve decoding performance.\n\nTermination is particularly important in convolutional codes as it ensures that the influence of the initial state of the encoder does not affect the decoded bits. This consideration enhances the performance of the Viterbi or BCJR decoders when dealing with finite-length sequences. It is worth noting that enabling termination slightly reduces the effective code rate because additional bits are required to terminate the code.\n\nTo create an instance of the `ConvEncoder` class with code termination enabled:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.conv import ConvEncoder\n\n# Create an encoder instance with termination enabled\nencoder = ConvEncoder(rate=1/2, constraint_length=3, terminate=True)\n```\n\nThe created encoder instance will have code termination enabled, meaning it will append extra bits to return the encoder to the all-zero state. It's important to ensure that when creating a corresponding decoder instance\u2014such as `ViterbiDecoder` or `BCJRDecoder`\u2014the `terminate` parameter is set consistently to ensure that the decoder correctly interprets the termination of the encoder. If the encoder is terminated, the decoder should also expect a terminated sequence, otherwise, it will lead to decoding errors."}]}

Moreover, it is assumed that the duration of the cyclic prefix (CP) equals at least the maximum delay spread. These assumptions are common in the literature, as they enable modeling of the channel transfer function in the frequency domain as a single-tap channel.\n\nFor every link $(u, k, v, l)$ and resource element $(s,n)$, the frequency channel response is obtained by computing the Fourier transform of the channel response at the subcarrier frequencies, i.e., $\\begin{split}\\begin{align}\n\\widehat{h}_{u, k, v, l, s, n}\n   &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} h_{u, k, v, l}(s,\\tau) e^{-j2\\pi n \\Delta_f \\tau} d\\tau\\\\\n   &= \\sum_{m=0}^{M-1} a_{u, k, v, l, m}(s)\n   e^{-j2\\pi n \\Delta_f \\tau_{u, k, v, l, m}}\n\\end{align}\\end{split}$\n\nwhere $s$ is used as time step to indicate that the channel response can change from one OFDM symbol to the next in the event of mobility, even if it is assumed static over the duration of an OFDM symbol.\n\nFor every receive antenna $l$ of every receiver $v$, the received signal $y_{v, l, s, n}$ for resource element $(s, n)$ is computed by $y_{v, l, s, n} = \\sum_{u=0}^{N_{T}-1}\\sum_{k=0}^{N_{TA}-1}\n   \\widehat{h}_{u, k, v, l, s, n} x_{u, k, s, n}\n   + w_{v, l, s, n}$ where $x_{u, k, s, n}$  is the baseband symbol transmitted by transmitter $u$ on antenna $k$ and resource element $(s, n)$, and $w_{v, l, s, n} \\sim \\mathcal{CN}\\left(0,N_0\\right)$ the additive white Gaussian noise.\n\n**Note:** This model does not account for intersymbol interference (ISI) nor intercarrier interference (ICI). To model the ICI due to channel aging over the duration of an OFDM symbol or the ISI due to a delay spread exceeding the CP duration, one would need to simulate the channel in the time domain. This can be achieved by using the OFDMModulator and OFDMDemodulator layers, and the time domain channel model. By doing so, one performs inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) on the transmitter side and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) on the receiver side on top of a single-carrier sinc-shaped waveform. This is equivalent to simulating the channel in the frequency domain if no ISI nor ICI is assumed, but allows the simulation of these effects in the event of a non-stationary channel or long delay spreads. Note that simulating the channel in the time domain is typically significantly more computationally demanding that simulating the channel in the frequency domain."}]}

The `frozen_pos` parameter represents the positions in the codeword that are fixed to a known value (often zero); these are not used to transmit information and are typically set according to a predetermined pattern that is optimized for certain channel conditions.\n\nThe `n` parameter refers to the length of the codeword, which is the total number of bits in the codeword including both the frozen and information bits. This parameter determines the block size that the decoder will process. The `num_iter` parameter indicates the number of iterations the belief propagation algorithm will run during the decoding process. More iterations may lead to better error correction performance but will also increase the computational complexity.\n\nThe `hard_out` parameter is a boolean flag that determines the format of the output. When `hard_out` is set to `True`, the decoder outputs hard decisions (bits), which are the final estimations of the transmitted information bits. When `hard_out` is set to `False`, the decoder provides soft-output information in the form of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), which can be advantageous in certain scenarios such as when the decoder output is fed into another channel decoder in a serially concatenated scheme.\n\nHere\u2019s a general outline of how to initialize a `PolarBPDecoder` using the Sionna library, ensuring that appropriate packages are imported:\n\n1. Import the `PolarBPDecoder` class from the Sionna library:\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.decoding import PolarBPDecoder\n```\n\n2. Generate the `frozen_pos` using a utility function provided by Sionna:\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.utils import generate_5g_ranking\n# k represents the number of information bits\n# Here, you should replace k with the actual number of information bits\nk = ... # Define the number of information bits\nn = ...\nfrozen_pos, info_pos = generate_5g_ranking(k, n)\n```\n\n3. Instantiate the `PolarBPDecoder` with the specified parameters:\n```python\n# n represents the codeword length\n# num_iter represents the number of decoding iterations\n# hard_out indicates whether to return hard decisions or soft-output (LLRs)\ndecoder = PolarBPDecoder(frozen_pos=frozen_pos,\n                         n=n,\n                         num_iter=20, # choose your own\n                         hard_out=False) # choose your own\n```\n\nIn the context of neural network models, it is important to note that this decoder is implemented as a Keras layer and can be used in such models. Keep in mind that you need to have actual values for `n`, `num_iter`, and determine whether `hard_out` should be `True` or `False` based on your application's requirements. If you intend to decode coded bits that include a CRC or to feed these bits into another decoder, using soft-output may be preferable."}]}

It quantifies the average probability of bit errors, which are caused by noise, interference, distortion, or bit synchronization errors. In the context of Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM), BER is calculated by comparing the transmitted bit sequence with the received bit sequence after demapping and decoding.\n\nTo calculate bitwise BERs, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Generate a binary sequence of information bits.\n2. Encode the information bits into codewords using an encoder (e.g., LDPC5GEncoder).\n3. Map the codewords to complex-valued symbols using a mapper (e.g., Mapper).\n4. Transmit the symbols over a noisy channel (e.g., AWGN).\n5. Demap the received noisy symbols into bit-wise Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) using a demapper (e.g., Demapper).\n6. Decode the LLRs into estimated information bits using a decoder (e.g., LDPC5GDecoder).\n7. Compare the estimated information bits with the original information bits. The BER is the ratio of the number of bit errors to the total number of bits transmitted.\n\nForward Error Correction (FEC) plays a crucial role in this process. FEC adds redundancy to the transmitted information using an encoder. This redundancy allows the decoder to detect and correct a limited number of errors without needing a reverse channel to request the retransmission of data. In the context of BICM, FEC is performed before the interleaving and mapping stages. The LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) code is a popular FEC code due to its near-capacity performance and iterative decoding algorithm.\n\nIn the case of mismatched demapping, where the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is unknown, min-sum decoding can have practical advantages. Min-sum decoding is a simplified version of the belief propagation algorithm for decoding LDPC codes. It approximates the sum-product algorithm, resulting in a less complex and more robust decoder in the presence of noise estimation errors."}]}

These probabilities are calculated from a list of candidate vectors (or paths) provided by a MIMO detector.\n\nThe dimensions of 'llr' are [num_streams, num_bits_per_symbol] which means that for each stream in the MIMO system, and for each bit in each symbol transmitted, there is an LLR value. \n\nThe values of LLRs in 'llr' are floating point numbers because these values may not always be whole numbers. The concept of Log-Likelihood Ratio in general allows for fractional values due to the mathematical operations involved. This ability for fractional values allows for more precise measures of probabilities.\n\nIt's important to note that the 'List2LLR' class provides an abstract base for callable methods to compute the LLRs.

If LLR mode is activated, the channel models return log-likelihood ratios instead of binary outputs. These LLRs can be used to evaluate the likelihood of a particular input sequence given the received output sequence, aiding in error detection and correction processes. \n\nMoreover, in some of these channels like the BinarySymmetricChannel, the LLRs are defined based on the bit flipping probability, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the level of errors introduced during the transmission. The LLR also features in the BinaryErasureChannel where it's based on the erasure probability.\n\nIn conclusion, the importance of the log-likelihood ratio in the Sionna API lies in its role in model error probabilities in channel transmissions, aid in the decoding process, and improve the efficiency and accuracy of data communication."}]}

It's designed to handle filtering operations like pulse shaping, windowing, upsampling, and downsampling. These operations are often required in signal processing tasks such as in the context of digital communications where, for instance, pulse shaping is used to limit the bandwidth of a transmitted signal while reducing inter-symbol interference.\n\nYou'll notice from the provided context that there are subclasses of the Filter class such as the SincFilter, RaisedCosineFilter, RootRaisedCosineFilter, and CustomFilter, each of which implements a specific type of filter. These filters can have various properties like \"length\", \"normalize\", and \"window\", and provide methods for plotting the impulse response or magnitude response of the filter.\n\nTo interact with the Filter or its subclasses in the Sionna package, you would typically first create an instance of the desired filter specifying the required parameters like span_in_symbols, samples_per_symbol, etc. Then, this filter instance is used to filter an input sequence by calling it like a function with the sequence as an argument.\n\nFor example:\n```python\n# Create instance of a RootRaisedCosineFilter\nrrcf_hann = RootRaisedCosineFilter(span_in_symbols, samples_per_symbol, beta, window=\\\\\"hann\\\\\")\n\n# Use the filter instance to filter an input sequence x_us\nx_rrcf = rrcf_hann(x_us)\n```\nIn this code snippet, a root-raised-cosine filter with a span of 'span_in_symbols' symbols and an oversampling factor of 'samples_per_symbol' is created. The filter is then used to filter the sequence 'x_us'. 'beta' is the roll-off factor for this type of filter and 'hann' specifies the windowing function used.\n\nYou\u2019ll note that the Filter class and its subclasses interact closely with other elements in the Sionna package like the Window class and the Upsampling and Downsampling classes. These are used to implement windowing and sample rate modification techniques respectively."}]}

This can be used to compute channel impulse responses (CIRs) using the `cir()` method. \n\nRemember that configuring your `Scene` correctly, including setting the antenna arrays for transmitters and receivers, is crucial before calling the `compute_paths()` method.\n\nApart from the computational functionality, the rendered propagation paths can also be visualized within a scene:\n\n```python\n# Visualize paths\nscene.preview(paths=paths)\n```\n\nThis will open a preview of the scene showing the computed propagation paths."}]}

Compare the empirical ACLR with the theoretical ACLR: If the two values are close, it means that the empirical ACLR is well aligned with the theoretical ACLR. If they are not close, it may indicate that there are some issues with the pulse-shaping filter or the computation of the empirical ACLR.\n\nRemember that the ACLR is a measure of the power leakage into adjacent frequency channels. A lower ACLR value indicates better performance as it means less power is leaking into adjacent channels."}]}

The function is based on the model where the received signal vector is the product of known channel matrix, the symbol vector, and a noise vector. \n\nThe function takes in three parameters which are:\n1. `y`: This is a 1+D tensor that contains the received signals.\n2. `h`: A 2+D tensor that holds the channel matrices.\n3. `s`: This is another 2+D tensor that carries the noise covariance matrices.\n\nUpon execution, the `mf_equalizer` function returns two outputs. The first output, `x_hat`, is a 1+D tensor that represents the estimated symbol vectors. The second output, `no_eff`, is a tensor having the same shape as `x_hat`. `no_eff` consists of the effective noise variance estimates.\n\nThe function assumes that the transmitted symbols, received signal vectors, channel matrices, and noise vectors follow a specific set of expectations and assumptions. This involves rendering certain assumptions such as having streams precoded with a unit norm vector, achieving equalization through the filter, and considering a number of symmetry constraints. \n\nPlease note that to use the function in Graph mode with XLA (within a function decorated with `@tf.function(jit_compile=True)`), you must set `sionna.Config.xla_compat=true`."}]}

The LLR values play a crucial role in the decoding process as they represent the likelihood of each bit being a '0' or a '1'. An LLR is positive if a bit is more likely to be '0', negative if it is more likely to be '1', and closer to zero if there is uncertainty.\n\nHere's how you can use an `LDPC5GDecoder` instance for decoding LLRs:\n\n1. Create an instance of the `LDPC5GDecoder`. You need to provide it with an `LDPC5GEncoder` instance and specify other parameters such as the number of iterations for belief propagation decoding:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.ldpc.decoding import LDPC5GDecoder\nfrom sionna.fec.ldpc.encoding import LDPC5GEncoder\n\n# Assume we have an encoder instance already created\nencoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k=100, n=200)\n\n# Create a decoder instance\ndecoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder=encoder,\n                        num_iter=20,          # number of BP iterations\n                        return_infobits=True) # If True, only return information bits\n```\n\n2. Obtain the LDPC-encoded data that has been transmitted over a channel and demapped to log-likelihood ratios (LLRs).\n\n3. Pass the received LLRs to the `LDPC5GDecoder` instance to decode:\n\n```python\n# llr is an array of LLR values with the shape [..., n]\ndecoded_data = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe output `decoded_data` will contain the estimated information bits.\n\nThe significance of the LLR values in this process is summarized below:\n\n- **Magnitude of LLR**: The absolute value of the LLR indicates the confidence level of the received bit; higher values mean higher confidence.\n- **Sign of LLR**: A positive LLR value leans towards a '0' bit, whereas a negative LLR value suggests a '1' bit.\n- **LLR Values Near Zero**: LLR values close to zero indicate less confidence in bit estimation, as the probability of being '0' or '1' is similar.\n\nThe LDPC decoder uses these LLRs in the belief propagation algorithm to iteratively update the messages between the nodes of the LDPC code graph and estimate the transmitted codeword bits. The number of iterations (`num_iter` parameter) can affect the accuracy and complexity of the decoding process. \n\nFinally, note that the `LDPC5GDecoder` abstracts some of the complexities that arise from puncturing and shortening used in rate matching according to the 5G New Radio standard, ensuring that your decoder is compliant with the standard when used in conjunction with the appropriate `LDPC5GEncoder`."}]}

The parameters include the number of antennas at the user terminal (UT) and base station (BS), the number of data streams, the CDL model, and the speed of the UT.\n\n2. **Generate the channel impulse response (CIR)**: The CIR is generated using the CDL model.

It includes the path gains and delays for each path.\n\n3. **Convert the CIR to the frequency domain or time domain**: Depending on whether you want to simulate the channel in the frequency or time domain, you need to convert the CIR accordingly. For frequency domain simulations, the Fourier transform of the CIR is computed at a set of frequencies corresponding to the different subcarriers. For time domain simulations, the CIR is first filtered with a perfect low-pass filter and then sampled at the Nyquist rate.\n\n4. **Apply the channel to the input signal**: The channel is applied to the input signal to generate the channel output.

This can be done using the LMMSEEqualizer function.\n\nThe choice between time and frequency domain simulations depends on the specific scenario.

The class plays a crucial role in managing desired or interfering channel coefficients for precoding and equalization. Its proper use can be understood with reference to the core code of the `LMMSEEqualizer` and `ZFPrecoder` from the Sionna package itself. \n\nThe various properties allow the class to accomplish complex tasks like determining indices needed for gather operations, identifying the number of interfering, transmitted, and received streams, managing stream to receiver and transmitter mapping, and more. These properties and methods collectively make the `StreamManagement` class a key component in managing streams in MIMO networks. It is crucial to ensure efficient and effective transmission and reception, thus contributing to the overall performance of communication over the network."}]}

It calculates propagation paths and coverage maps that make possible to optimize and test different aspects of wireless communication using simulations.\n\n2. **Antenna Modeling**: The code presents an extensive implementation for modeling different antenna patterns. It supports the creation of single- or dual-polarized antennas each with possibly different antenna patterns. The classes include computation of gain, visualization of patterns, and both predefined and custom antenna patterns. These modelling tools enable a more realistic simulation of real-world scenarios and help engineer efficient antenna designs.\n\n3. **Transmitters and Receivers**: The code allows to model transmitters and receivers that are equipped with antenna arrays. These can be set and controlled via Scene property. This allows to simulate more complex scenarios with multiple antennas and evaluate the system performance in these scenarios.\n\n4. **Link-level Simulations**: The code provides the possibility of transforming propagation paths into time-varying channel impulse responses (CIRs) which can be used in link-level simulations. This way, it can be used to study the impact of the propagation environment on the wireless signal propagation, which, in turn, affects the performance of radio communication systems.\n\n5. **Coverage Map**: The CoverageMap class helps to carry out site-specific path loss prediction which is paramount to efficient wireless network planning and optimization. It gives insights about the geographical distribution of signal strength and helps in optimal placement of antennas and transmitters.\n\n6. **Scene Preview and Rendering**: The functions are provided to preview a scene within a notebook or render it to a file. This can help to visually check and debug the propagation model, or to visualize the results for a given wireless networking scenario.\n\n7. **Dataset Creation**: It provides the creation of a dataset of CIRs (Channel Impulse Response) which can be used by a channel model. This dataset can aid machine learning models to learn the radio propagation characteristics, paving the way for AI/ML in radio propagation modelling.\n\nThese functions and classes can greatly aid system and network design, performance prediction, and optimization strategies. Their utilization fosters a deep understanding of radio wave behaviors and enhances the effectiveness and adaptability of antenna designs under various real world scenarios."}]}

Please note that the implemented\n    Raman amplification currently results in a transparent fiber link.

The process starts with the detector, which uses the a priori information to detect the transmitted symbols. The detector then calculates the a posteriori information and the extrinsic information, which are passed to the decoder. The decoder uses this information to decode the received symbols and generate new a posteriori and extrinsic information, which are then passed back to the detector for the next iteration. This iterative process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or a certain level of confidence in the decoded bits. \n\nIn the context of IDD, the SISO MMSE-PIC detector turned out to work better when provided with the full a posteriori information from the decoder.

The frozen bit positions can be obtained using the utility function `generate_5g_ranking` provided in Sionna if you are decoding a 5G-compliant Polar code. Otherwise, the frozen positions have to be known or determined according to the specific Polar code construction.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `PolarSCDecoder` following the Sionna library's API:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.utils import generate_5g_ranking\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.decoding import PolarSCDecoder\n\n# Assuming k is the number of information bits and n is the codeword length\nk = 128  # Example value\nn = 256  # Example value, must be a power of two\n\n# Generate 5G frozen and information bit positions\nfrozen_pos, info_pos = generate_5g_ranking(k, n)\n\n# Create an instance of the decoder\nsc_decoder = PolarSCDecoder(frozen_pos=frozen_pos, n=n)\n\n# Generate a random llr_tensor for demonstration purposes\n# Shape of llr_tensor should be [1, n] for a single codeword\nllr_tensor = np.random.randn(1, n)\n\n# Decode the bits\ndecoded_bits = sc_decoder(llr_tensor)\n\n```\n\nThe output tensor `decoded_bits` produced by `PolarSCDecoder` contains the hard-decided estimations of all the `k` information bits. It has the same first dimensions as the input LLR tensor `llr_tensor`, and the last dimension is equal to `k`. So if `llr_tensor` has the shape `[..., n]`, the shape of `decoded_bits` would be `[..., k]`, where `...` represents any number of batch dimensions you might have.\n\nKeep in mind that to run the above Python code successfully, you should have the `llr_tensor` containing the LLR values appropriately initialized. These LLR values typically come from the demodulation stage of a received signal in a communication system and would need to be defined based on your specific application and data."}]}

It determines the scenario for which the rate-matching rules are applied, as the uplink and downlink scenarios might have different rules and interleaving patterns according to the 3GPP specifications.\n\n- `dtype` (parameter type: `tf.DType`): The default value for this parameter is `tf.float32`, which indicates the data type of the output tensor from the encoder.

In the context of optical fibers, attenuation is typically caused by absorption, scattering, and bending losses. In the given context, a typical value of attenuation is given as 0.046 per kilometer.\n\nTo compensate for this attenuation, Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs) are used. EDFAs are a type of optical amplifier that uses a doped optical fiber as a gain medium to amplify an optical signal. They are used in optical communication systems to compensate for loss introduced by the transmission medium.\n\nIn the given context, the EDFA is used in a lumped amplification channel model, which consists of multiple fiber spans and optical amplifiers. The gain of the amplifier, denoted by G, is chosen such that the link becomes transparent, meaning the input power equals the output power. This effectively compensates for the attenuation introduced by the optical fiber.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while EDFAs compensate for attenuation, they also introduce noise, specifically Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) noise. This is the most dominant source of noise in an optical channel model. The noise power depends on the gain of the amplifier, the noise figure of the EDFA, the carrier frequency, and the simulation bandwidth. Despite this, EDFAs are essential in optical communication systems to ensure the signal can be transmitted over long distances."}]}

Notably, a CoverageMap isn't uniquely defined as it depends on the transmitter and receiver arrays, their respective antenna patterns, their orientations, and the transmit pre-coding and receive combining vectors. \n\nTo compute a CoverageMap in Sionna, you can use the `coverage_map()` method from the Scene class. This method returns an instance of the CoverageMap class, which contains methods to perform tasks related to coverage maps.\n\nVisualising a CoverageMap can be done by providing the computed coverage map as an argument to either the `render()`, `render_to_file()`, or `preview()` functions of the Scene class. Alternatively, this can be achieved by using the method `show()` in the CoverageMap class for visualisation.\n\nIt's important to note that coverage maps are not continuous but rather discrete due to the need to quantize the plane into small rectangular bins for practical computations.

Berrou, A. Glavieux, P. Thitimajshima, \u201cNear Shannon limit error-correcting coding and decoding: Turbo-codes\u201d, IEEE ICC, 1993.]. Takes as input LLRs and returns LLRs or hard decided bits, i.e., an estimate of the information tensor.\n\nThis decoder is based on the BCJRDecoder and, thus, internally instantiates two BCJRDecoder layers.  \n  \nThe class inherits from the Keras layer class and can be used as layer in a Keras model.  \n  \n### Parameters\n\n- **encoder** (`TurboEncoder`): If `encoder` is provided as input, the following input parameters are not required and will be ignored: `gen_poly`, `rate`, `constraint_length`, `terminate`, `interleaver`. They will be inferred from the encoder object itself. If `encoder` is `None`, the above parameters must be provided explicitly.\n\n- **gen_poly** (tuple): Tuple of strings with each string being a 0, 1 sequence. If `None`, `rate` and `constraint_length` must be provided.\n\n- **rate** (float): Rate of the Turbo code. Valid values are 1/3 and 1/2. Note that `gen_poly`, if provided, is used to encode the underlying convolutional code, which traditionally has rate 1/2.\n\n- **constraint_length** (int): Valid values are between 3 and 6 inclusive. Only required if `encoder` and `gen_poly` are `None`.\n\n- **interleaver** (str): \"3GPP\" or \"Random\". If \"3GPP\", the internal interleaver for Turbo codes as specified in [3GPPTS36212_Turbo] will be used. Only required if `encoder` is `None`.\n\n- **terminate** (bool): If `True`, the two underlying convolutional encoders are assumed to have terminated to all zero state.\n\n- **num_iter** (int): Number of iterations for the Turbo decoding to run. Each iteration of Turbo decoding entails one BCJR decoder for each of the underlying convolutional code components.\n\n- **hard_out** (boolean): Defaults to `True` and indicates whether to output hard or soft decisions on the decoded information vector. `True` implies a hard-decoded information vector of 0/1\u2019s is output. `False` implies decoded LLRs of the information is output.\n\n- **algorithm** (str): Defaults to `map`. Indicates the implemented BCJR algorithm, where `map` denotes the exact MAP algorithm, `log` indicates the exact MAP implementation, but in log-domain, and `maxlog` indicates the approximated MAP implementation in log-domain, where $\\log(e^{a}+e^{b}) \\sim \\max(a,b)$.\n\n- **output_dtype** (tf.DType): Defaults to `tf.float32`. Defines the output datatype of the layer.\n\n### Input\n\n- **inputs** (`tf.float32`): 2+D tensor of shape `[\u2026,n]` containing the (noisy) channel output symbols where `n` is the codeword length.\n\n### Output\n\n- **output** (`tf.float32`): 2+D tensor of shape `[\u2026,coderate*n]` containing the estimates of the information bit tensor.\n  \n**Note: **  \nFor decoding, input logits defined as $\\operatorname{log} \\frac{p(x=1)}{p(x=0)}$ are assumed for compatibility with the rest of Sionna. Internally, log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) with definition $\\operatorname{log} \\frac{p(x=0)}{p(x=1)}$ are used.  \n  \n### Properties\n\n- **coderate**\n  - Description: Rate of the code used in the encoder.\n\n- **constraint_length**\n  - Description: Constraint length of the encoder.\n\n- **gen_poly**\n  - Description: Generator polynomial used by the encoder.\n\n- **k**\n  - Description: Number of information bits per codeword.\n\n- **n**\n  - Description: Number of codeword bits.\n\n- **trellis**\n  - Description: Trellis object used during encoding.\n\n### Method\n\n- **depuncture(y)**\n  - Description: Given a tensor `y` of shape `[batch, n]`, `depuncture()` scatters `y` elements into shape `[batch, 3*rate*n]` where the extra elements are filled with `0`. For example, if input is `y`, rate is `1/2` and `punct_pattern` is `[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`, then the output is `[y[0], y[1], 0., y[2], 0., y[3], y[4], y[5], 0., \u2026 ,]`.\n\n\nsource code: [TurboDecoder](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/_modules/sionna/fec/turbo/decoding.html#TurboDecoder)  \n  "}]}

This is usually done via the pip package manager in Python. You can install Sionna by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt.\n\n   ```\n   pip install sionna\n   ```\n\n   If there are specific version requirements or if you need to install it from a source other than PyPI, please ensure you have the correct command or source to install from.\n\n2. **Import Sionna APIs**: Once Sionna is installed, you can import the necessary components from the package into your Python script or interactive environment. For instance, if you want to use the `LinearEncoder`, `AllZeroEncoder`, or `OSDecoder`, you would use the following import statements:\n\n   ```python\n   from sionna.fec.linear import LinearEncoder\n   from sionna.fec.linear import AllZeroEncoder\n   from sionna.fec.linear import OSDecoder\n   ```\n\n   These lines of code exactly match the components provided by the Sionna package and should be used verbatim as they ensure you are importing the correct classes.\n\n3. **Use Sionna APIs**: After importing the APIs, you can use them according to the Sionna documentation. Below is an example of how to create instances of the encoder and decoder using the APIs:\n\n   ```python\n   # Assuming you have a parity-check matrix named 'pcm'\n   # Initialize the encoder with a parity-check matrix\n   encoder = LinearEncoder(enc_mat=pcm, is_pcm=True)\n   \n   # Initialize the OSD decoder with the parity-check matrix and specify the order 't'\n   decoder = OSDecoder(pcm, t=4, is_pcm=True)  # t is the OSD order\n   ```\n\n   Keep in mind that these are just examples and your actual initialization will depend on the specifics of your application and the parameters needed for the `LinearEncoder` and `OSDecoder`.\n\n4. **Verify Installation**: To verify that Sionna is installed correctly and that you can use its APIs, run a simple test by creating an encoder or decoder instance and performing an operation. If there are any errors, check that the package is installed correctly and that your code matches the API documentation.\n\n5. **Refer to Documentation**: For detailed usage of the Sionna package and its APIs, refer to the official Sionna documentation and examples. This will provide you with more in-depth information about each component's parameters, methods, and expected input/output data, allowing you to leverage the full functionality of the package."}]}

Below are considerations of these potential errors based on the context provided:\n\n### Assertions in `Polar5GEncoder`\nThe `AssertionError` could be raised in several situations:\n\n1. When the parameters `k` (number of information bits per codeword) and `n` (codeword length) are not positive integers or when `k` is not smaller or equal to `n`. Here is an example of a code snippet that could lead to an `AssertionError` if conditions are not met:\n\n   ```python\n   from sionna.fec.polar.encoding import Polar5GEncoder\n   encoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=100, n=200)  # Ensure k and n meet the conditions\n   ```\n\n2. If `n` and `k` are not based on valid 5G code parameters as defined in the specification.\n\n3. If the `verbose` parameter is not of boolean type. An `AssertionError` would be raised if something other than `True` or `False` is passed.\n\n4. For the `Polar5GEncoder.channel_interleaver` function, if the input array's length is not a multiple of 32, it will trigger an `AssertionError`.\n\n### Value Errors in `Polar5GEncoder`\nA `ValueError` could be raised under the following conditions:\n\n1. If the `dtype` is not supported. The `Polar5GEncoder` defaults the `dtype` to `tf.float32`, but if a user attempts to set a `dtype` that is not allowed, a `ValueError` would be raised.\n\n2. For potential restrictions such as the maximum length of codeword bits (`n`) being 1088, and, in the downlink scenario, the maximum allowable `k` (i.e., information bits) due to the size of the input bit interleaver.\n\nIt is essential for users to comply with these specifications when creating an instance of the `Polar5GEncoder`. Otherwise, they will encounter these errors. Whenever setting up the encoder found in the `sionna.fec.polar.encoding` module, it is important to ensure that the values used to initialize it are verified against the specific conditions that could raise the `AssertionError` or `ValueError`.\n\nAs with any API usage, referencing the official Sionna documentation can provide the most accurate and updated information for preventing and handling these errors. It is also advisable to handle these exceptions in code to provide a more robust and user-friendly implementation."}]}

Leveraging Lemma 1 from the reference [[Goala_LP]](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/fec.polar.html#goala-lp), this function serves a particular role in the context of Polar codes.\n\nThe primary purpose of the `generate_dense_polar` function is to facilitate the generation of a Polar code's parity-check matrix (PCM) and generator matrix (GM), which are essential for decoding operations. Specifically, these matrices can be used with the `LDPCBPDecoder` class within the framework. However, the function's output matrices are usually not sparse, indicating that the parity-check matrix is densely populated with a substantial number of ones compared to zeros. This characteristic generally makes it unsuitable for belief propagation (BP) decoding due to the presence of numerous short cycles within the graph. Instead, for iterative decoding processes over the encoding graph, users are recommended to employ the `PolarBPDecoder`.\n\nThe matrices generated are full rank and contain patterns of zeros and ones arranged according to Polar coding rules. The rows of the parity-check matrix are associated with the code's check equations, while the generator matrix's rows correspond to an encoder's operations that map the information bits to the codeword bits.\n\nThe key parameters for the `generate_dense_polar` function as provided in the context are:\n\n- `frozen_pos`: An array of `int` specifying the indices of the frozen positions within the Polar codeword of length `n`.\n- `n`: An `int` that defines the length of the codeword.\n- `verbose`: A `bool` that defaults to True. If set to True, the properties of the generated code will be printed.\n\nAnd the function's output consist of two ndarray matrices:\n\n- `pcm`: The parity-check matrix of dimensions `(n-k, n)`, where `k` is the number of information bits, and `n` is the codeword length.\n- `gm`: The generator matrix of dimensions `(k, n)`.\n\nThese matrices can theoretically enable linear block code decoding operations; however, their density implies a heavy computational cost and significant decoding complexity when applied to larger codes. Therefore, the matrices generated by `generate_dense_polar` are particularly useful for academic, experimental, and analytical purposes rather than practical implementations in communication systems where sparse matrices and low complexity decoding are critical. \n\nIn conclusion, the `generate_dense_polar` function is essential when the dense representation of the Polar coding matrices is required, primarily for educational and analysis purposes, rather than for actual decoding in practice."}]}

In the ternary output, for the binary configuration, `-1` indicates an erasure whereas `0` indicates an erasure for bipolar mode.\n\nWhen log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) are activated (`return_llrs=True`), the values are defined as following:\n$$\n\\ell =\n\\begin{cases}\n    -\\infty, \\qquad \\text{if} \\, y=0 \\\\\n    0, \\qquad \\quad \\,, \\text{if} \\, y=? \\\\\n    \\infty, \\qquad \\quad \\text{if} \\, y=1 \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThis class can be used as a layer in a Keras model as it inherits from Keras `Layer` class."}]}

If this product is even, a value of one will be added.\n\nThe filter is applied through discrete convolution.\n\nAn optional windowing function window can be applied to the filter.\n\nThe dtype of the output is tf.float if both x and the filter coefficients have dtype tf.float. Otherwise, the dtype of the output is tf.complex.\n\nThree padding modes are available for applying the filter:\n\n- \u201cfull\u201d (default): Returns the convolution at each point of overlap between x and the filter. The length of the output is N + K - 1. Zero-padding of the input x is performed to compute the convolution at the borders.\n- \u201csame\u201d: Returns an output of the same length as the input x. The convolution is computed such that the coefficients of the input x are centered on the coefficient of the filter with index (K-1)/2. Zero-padding of the input signal is performed to compute the convolution at the borders.\n- \u201cvalid\u201d: Returns the convolution only at points where x and the filter completely overlap. The length of the output is N - K + 1.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- `span_in_symbols` (int): Filter span as measured by the number of symbols. Only needs to be provided if `coefficients` is None.\n- `samples_per_symbol` (int): Number of samples per symbol, i.e., the oversampling factor. Must always be provided.\n- `coefficients` ([K], tf.float or tf.complex): Optional filter coefficients. If set to None, then a random filter of length K is generated by sampling a Gaussian distribution. Defaults to None.\n- `window` (Window or string [\"hann\", \"hamming\", \"blackman\"]): Instance of Window that is applied to the filter coefficients. Alternatively, a string indicating the window name can be provided, which will be instantiated with default parameters. Custom windows must be provided as an instance.\n- `normalize` (bool): If True, the filter is normalized to have unit power. Defaults to True.\n- `trainable` (bool): If True, the filter coefficients are trainable variables. Defaults to False.\n- `dtype` (tf.DType): The dtype of the filter coefficients. Defaults to tf.float32.\n\n### Input\n\n- `x` ([..., N], tf.complex or tf.float): The input to which the filter is applied. The filter is applied along the last dimension.\n- `padding` (string [\"full\", \"valid\", \"same\"]): Padding mode for convolving x and the filter. Must be one of \"full\", \"valid\", or \"same\". Case insensitive. Defaults to \"full\".\n- `conjugate` (bool): If True, the complex conjugate of the filter is applied. Defaults to False.\n\n### Output\n\n- `y` ([..., M], tf.complex or tf.float): Filtered input. It is tf.float only if both x and the filter are tf.float. It is tf.complex otherwise. The length M depends on the padding.\n\n### Properties\n\n**Property: `aclr`**\n- ACLR of the filter. This ACLR corresponds to using the filter as a pulse shaping filter on an i.i.d. sequence of symbols. The in-band is assumed to range from [-0.5, 0.5] in normalized frequency.\n\n**Property: `coefficients`**\n- The filter coefficients (after normalization).\n\n**Property: `length`**\n- The filter length in samples.\n\n**Property: `normalize`**\n- True if the filter is normalized to have unit power.\n\n**Property: `sampling_times`**\n- Sampling times in multiples of the symbol duration.\n\n**Property: `trainable`**\n- True if the filter coefficients are trainable.\n\n**Property: `window`**\n- The window function that is applied to the filter coefficients. None if no window is applied.\n\n### Method: `show(response='impulse', scale='lin')`\n\nPlot the impulse or magnitude response\n\nPlots the impulse response (time domain) or magnitude response (frequency domain) of the filter.\n\nFor the computation of the magnitude response, a minimum DFT size of 1024 is assumed which is obtained through zero padding of the filter coefficients in the time domain.\n\n- **Input**:\n  - `response` (str, one of [\"impulse\", \"magnitude\"]): The desired response type. Defaults to \"impulse\".\n  - `scale` (str, one of [\"lin\", \"db\"]): The y-scale of the magnitude response. Can be \"lin\" (linear) or \"db\" (decibel). Defaults to \"lin\"."}]}

In the provided context, the CDL model is created with the `CDL` class from the Sionna library. You can change the `cdl_model` parameter to switch between different CDL models (A, B, C, D, E). Then, you can simulate the channel and calculate the bit error rate (BER) or block error rate (BLER) to evaluate the performance.\n\n2. **Impact of imperfect CSI**: To investigate the impact of imperfect CSI, you can simulate the system with and without perfect CSI. In the provided context, the `perfect_csi` parameter is used to switch between perfect and imperfect CSI. When `perfect_csi` is `False`, the least squares (LS) channel estimator is used to estimate the channel state information.\n\n3. **Channel aging due to mobility**: You can simulate the impact of mobility by changing the `speed` parameter when creating the CDL model. The `speed` parameter represents the speed of the user terminal (UT). By comparing the performance at different speeds, you can investigate the impact of channel aging due to mobility.\n\n4. **Inter-symbol interference due to insufficient cyclic prefix length**: To investigate the impact of insufficient cyclic prefix length, you can simulate the system with different cyclic prefix lengths. In the provided context, the `cyclic_prefix_length` parameter is used to set the length of the cyclic prefix. By comparing the performance at different cyclic prefix lengths, you can investigate the impact of inter-symbol interference.\n\nRemember to run multiple simulations for each configuration to get statistically significant results.

You need to import the `AWGN` class from the Sionna channel module. This can be done with the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.channel import AWGN\n```\n\n2. You then create an instance of the AWGN channel. The AWGN class in Sionna stands for Additive White Gaussian Noise class. This class adds complex AWGN with a certain variance to the input.\n\n```python\nawgn_channel = AWGN()\n```\n3. After the setup, you can then run the AWGN channel. The AWGN channel takes as input a tuple containing the input signal `x` and the noise variance `no`.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n# you need to choose your own parameters\n# Parameters\nbatch_size = 1\nnum_samples = 1024  # Number of samples in the signal\n\n# x: Channel input\nx = tf.complex(\n    tf.random.normal([batch_size, num_samples], dtype=tf.float32),\n    tf.random.normal([batch_size, num_samples], dtype=tf.float32)\n)\n\n# no: Noise power variance\n# Scalar example: uniform noise across all samples\nno = tf.constant(0.01, dtype=tf.float32)\n\n# Alternatively, for non-uniform noise across different samples:\n# no = tf.random.uniform([batch_size, num_samples], minval=0.01, maxval=0.02, dtype=tf.float32)\n\n# Apply the AWGN channel\ny = awgn_channel((x, no)) # (x, no) is tuple\n\nprint(\"Output shape:\", y.shape)\n```\n4. The output `y` is the result of the AWGN channel applied to the input signal `x` with noise variance `no`.\n\nRemember to replace `x` and `no` with your actual input and noise variance values. The input `x` should be a Tensor with a dtype of complex64, and `no` should be a scalar or Tensor with a compatible shape to `x` and a dtype of float. `no` represents the noise power per complex dimension.\n\nWhile the operation is a layer compatible with Keras models, it's important to note that there is a bit of a difference compared to typical Keras layers when it comes to running the AWGN channel. For most Keras layers, you would typically pass the input directly to the layer object, like `layer(input)`. For the AWGN channel, you need to pass in a tuple of `(x, no)`, where `x` is your channel input and `no` is the noise variance, as we saw earlier. \n\nLastly, for convenience and versatility, the `AWGN` class includes support for running the layer with either a scalar `no` or a `no` Tensor that can be broadcast to the shape of the input."}]}

First, you need to import the necessary libraries.

Load the simulation results. The simulation results are stored in a dictionary named `SIMS`. You can load the results using the `pickle` module.\n\n```python\nwith open('simulation_results.pkl', 'rb') as f:\n    SIMS = pickle.load(f)\n```\n\n3. Plot the BLER against $E_b/N_0$ for different 3GPP 38.901 Models. You can use the `plt.semilogy` function from matplotlib to create the plot. The `SIMS` dictionary contains the BLER results for different scenarios and whether perfect CSI was used.\n\n```python\nplt.figure()\nplt.xlabel(r\"$E_b/N_0$ (dB)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"BLER\")\nplt.grid(which=\"both\")\ni=0\nlegend = []\nfor scenario in SIMS[\"scenario\"]:\n    for perfect_csi in SIMS[\"perfect_csi\"]:\n        if scenario==\"umi\":\n            r = \"r\"\n            t = \"UMi\"\n        elif scenario==\"uma\":\n            r = \"b\"\n            t = \"UMa\"\n        else:\n            r = \"g\"\n            t = \"RMa\"\n        if perfect_csi:\n            r += \"-\"\n        else:\n            r += \"--\"\n        plt.semilogy(SIMS[\"ebno_db\"], SIMS[\"bler\"][i], r)\n        s = \"{} - {} CSI\".format(t,\"perf.\" if perfect_csi else \"imperf.\")\n        legend.append(s)\n        i += 1\nplt.legend(legend)\nplt.ylim([1e-3, 1])\nplt.title(\"Multiuser 4x8 MIMO Uplink over Different 3GPP 38.901 Models\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis will create a plot of the BLER against $E_b/N_0$ for different 3GPP 38.901 Models.

You can also add a title to the plot using the `title` function:\n\n```python\nplt.title('BER vs Eb/N0 for different channel models')\n```\n\nRemember to replace 'EbN0', 'BER', 'Model 1', 'Model 2', and 'Model 3' with your actual data and labels."}]}

HDF5 is a data model, library, and file format for storing and managing data. It supports an unlimited variety of datatypes and is designed for flexible and efficient I/O and for high volume and complex data.\n\nHere's how a generator is created for parsing an HDF5 file:\n\n```python\nclass HD5CIRGen:\n    def __init__(self, filename):\n        self.filename = filename\n    def __call__(self):\n        with h5py.File(self.filename, 'r') as hf:\n            for im in zip(hf[\"a\"], hf[\"tau\"]):\n                a = im[0]\n                tau = im[1]\n                # One could do some preprocessing on the dataset here\n                # ...\n                yield im\n```\n\nIn this example, a class `HD5CIRGen` is defined with a method `__call__` that opens the HDF5 file and iterates over its contents. The `yield` keyword is used to make this method a generator. When this method is called, it returns an iterator that can be looped over to retrieve the contents of the HDF5 file one item at a time. This can be particularly useful when dealing with large files that would be impractical to load into memory all at once. \n\nTo use the generator, an instance of the `HD5CIRGen` class is created with the filename of the HDF5 file as an argument.

This step is critical because incorrect parameters will not work as expected.\n\n    ```python\n    k = 100  # Number of information bits\n    n = 200  # Codeword length\n    encoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n    ```\n\n    Replace `k` and `n` with the required values depending on your use case. The values provided above are examples.\n\n3. **Provide the Information Bits**: The input data to be encoded should be in the form of a 2D or higher dimension tensor, where the last dimension should be equal to `k`. The tensor dtype should be `tf.float32` as it is the default dtype for the layer unless you've specified a different type upon creation.\n\n    Let's assume you have a numpy array `u` containing the information bits, which you need to convert into a TensorFlow tensor:\n\n    ```python\n    import tensorflow as tf\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Generate random information bits as a numpy array of integers\n    u_np = np.random.randint(2, size=k, dtype=np.int32) # write your own, here is just a sample\n\n    # Convert the array to float32 and add an extra dimension\n    u_np = u_np.astype(np.float32)[np.newaxis, :]  # Reshape from (100,) to (1, 100)\n\n    # Convert to a TensorFlow tensor\n    u = tf.convert_to_tensor(u_np, dtype=tf.float32)\n\n    ```\n\n    Ensure the shape of `u` confirms to `[..., k]`.\n\n4. **Encode the Information Bits**: Pass the tensor containing the information bits to the encoder to obtain the encoded codeword bits.\n\n    ```python\n    c = encoder(u)\n    ```\n\n    The output `c` is a tensor containing the Polar encoded codeword bits with the shape `[..., n]`.\n\n5. **Use the Encoded Codewords**: The encoded codewords `c` can now be used for further processing, such as modulation and transmission over a communication channel.\n\nPlease note that the ellipses `...` used in code snippets indicate that you should replace these with the actual content as per your specific requirements. The actual content of information bits (numpy array `u_np`) should be defined by you based on the context in which you apply the Polar5GEncoder.

The property `k` represents the number of information bits per codeword, and `n` represents the codeword length. The coderate is defined as the ratio of the number of information bits per codeword to the total number of bits in a codeword. Hence, the formula to calculate the coderate is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Coderate} = \\frac{k}{n} \\]\n\nFor the `LinearEncoder`, if you have already instantiated it, you can simply access the `coderate` property directly without the need to calculate it yourself. This property provides the coderate of the code that the `LinearEncoder` is set to encode. To access the `coderate`, you might use the following lines of code:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'encoder' is an instance of LinearEncoder\ncoderate = encoder.coderate\n```\n\nSimilarly, for the `AllZeroEncoder`, the coderate property is also available and can be accessed in an analogous manner:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'all_zero_encoder' is an instance of AllZeroEncoder\ncoderate = all_zero_encoder.coderate\n```\n\nNote that for both encoders, to get the values for `k` and `n`, if you need them individually or to verify the coderate calculation, you can also access them directly using their respective properties like so:\n\n```python\n# Accessing k and n for LinearEncoder\nk = encoder.k\nn = encoder.n\n\n# Accessing k and n for AllZeroEncoder\nk = all_zero_encoder.k\nn = all_zero_encoder.n\n```\n\nIt's important to mention that for the `AllZeroEncoder`, the coderate doesn't really denote the efficiency of the code since it always outputs an all-zero codeword, which serves a different purpose in simulations and validation.\n\nNow, if you don't already have an instance of the encoder and you need to use a matrix to instantiate one, you must know that the shape of the matrix you provide to the `LinearEncoder` will let you determine `k` and `n`. If the matrix is a generator matrix (and you are not setting `is_pcm=True`), the shape of the matrix `[k, n]` immediately provides you with the required `k` and `n`.\n\nIn conclusion, you have two options to find the coderate for both encoders in Sionna:\n\n1. Access the `coderate` property directly from an instance of the encoder, either `LinearEncoder` or `AllZeroEncoder`.\n2. Calculate the coderate using the formula `k / n` if you have the values of `k` and `n` either by accessing their properties or deducing them from the shape of the matrix you used to initialize the `LinearEncoder`."}]}

You can specify the types of paths (line-of-sight, reflection, diffraction, scattering) to be considered in the computation.\n\n```python\npaths = scene.compute_paths(num_samples=1e6, los=True, reflection=True, diffraction=True, scattering=False)\n```\n\n3. Obtain the channel impulse responses using the `cir` method of the paths object. This will return the complex amplitudes and delays of the paths.\n\n```python\na, tau = [np.squeeze(t) for t in paths.cir()]\n```\n\n4. Compute the gain for each path. This can be done by squaring the absolute value of the complex amplitude, taking the logarithm (base 10), and multiplying by 10 to convert to decibels.\n\n```python\ndef compute_gain(a, tau):\n    a = tf.squeeze(a, axis=-1)\n    h_f_2 = tf.math.abs(tf.reduce_sum(a, axis=-1))**2\n    h_f_2 = tf.where(h_f_2==0, 1e-24, h_f_2)\n    g_db = 10*np.log10(h_f_2)\n    return tf.squeeze(g_db)\n```\n\n5. Finally, you can visualize the channel impulse response for each receiver. For example, you can plot the delay (in nanoseconds) against the gain (in dB) for each path.\n\n```python\nn = 400\nplt.figure()\nplt.stem(tau[n]/1e-9, 10*np.log10(np.abs(a[n])**2))\nplt.title(f\"Angle of receiver $\\\\phi: {int(phi[n]/PI*180)}^\\\\circ$\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Delay (ns)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"$|a|^2$ (dB)\")\n```\n\nRemember to replace the scene, transmitter, and receiver configurations with your own settings."}]}

This class works by analyzing the received signals, the known channel matrices, as well as the noise covariance matrices to make an optimal decision about what was transmitted.\n\nThis is how it works:\n\n- Assuming a channel model `y = Hx + n` where `y` represents the received signal vector, `x` represents the vector of transmitted symbols, `H` represents the channel matrix, and `n` is a complex Gaussian noise vector.\n- Prior to demapping, the received signal is whitened.\n- It provides outcomes either as LLRs on bits or logits on the constellation symbols. \n- If hard decisions are requested, it returns symbol indices for each stream.\n\nThe parameters are:\n\n- `output (str)`: Specifies the type of output, either LLRs on bits or logits on constellation symbols.\n- `demapping_method (str)`: Specifies the demapping method to be used.\n- `num_streams (int)`: Specifies the number of transmitted streams.\n- `constellation_type (str)`: Specifies the type of the constellation, an instance of `Constellation` must be provided for the type 'custom'.\n- `num_bits_per_symbol (int)`: Specifies the number of bits per constellation symbol, e.g., 4 for QAM16.

H. Hardin and F. D. Tappert, \u201cApplications of the Split-Step Fourier Method to the Numerical Solution of Nonlinear and Variable Coefficient Wave Equations.\u201d, SIAM Review Chronicles, Vol. 15, No. 2, Part 1, p 423, 1973.]) numerically solves the generalized nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (NLSE) $\\frac{\\partial E(t,z)}{\\partial z}=-\\frac{\\alpha}{2} E(t,z)+j\\frac{\\beta_2}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 E(t,z)}{\\partial t^2}-j\\gamma |E(t,z)|^2 E(t,z) + n(n_{\\text{sp}};\\,t,\\,z)$ for an unpolarized (or single polarized) optical signal; or the Manakov equation (according to [P. K. A. Wai, C. R. Menyuk, and H. H. Chen, \u201cStability of Solitons in Randomly Varying Birefringent Fibers\u201d, Optics Letters, No. 16, 1991.]) $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}(t,z)}{\\partial z}=-\\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\mathbf{E}(t,z)+j\\frac{\\beta_2}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{E}(t,z)}{\\partial t^2}-j\\gamma \\frac{8}{9}||\\mathbf{E}(t,z)||_2^2 \\mathbf{E}(t,z) + \\mathbf{n}(n_{\\text{sp}};\\,t,\\,z)$ for dual polarization, with attenuation coefficient $\\alpha$, group velocity dispersion parameters $\\beta_2$, and nonlinearity coefficient $\\gamma$. The noise terms $n(n_{\\text{sp}};\\,t,\\,z)$ and $\\mathbf{n}(n_{\\text{sp}};\\,t,\\,z)$ , respectively, stem from an (optional) ideally distributed Raman amplification with spontaneous emission factor $n_\\text{sp}$. The optical signal $E(t,\\,z)$ has the unit $\\sqrt{\\text{W}}$. For the dual polarized case, $\\mathbf{E}(t,\\,z)=(E_x(t,\\,z), E_y(t,\\,z))$ is a vector consisting of the signal components of both polarizations.\n\nThe symmetrized SSFM is applied according to Eq. (7) of [J. A. Fleck, J. R. Morris, and M. D. Feit, \u201cTime-dependent Propagation of High Energy Laser Beams Through the Atmosphere\u201d, Appl. Phys., Vol. 10, pp 129\u2013160, 1976.] that can be written as $E(z+\\Delta_z,t) \\approx \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_z}{2}\\hat{D}\\right)\\exp\\left(\\int^{z+\\Delta_z}_z \\hat{N}(z')dz'\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_z}{2}\\hat{D}\\right)E(z,\\,t)$ where only the single-polarized case is shown. The integral is approximated by $\\Delta_z\\hat{N}$ with $\\hat{D}$ and $\\hat{N}$ denoting the linear and nonlinear SSFM operator, respectively [G. P. Agrawal, \u201cFiber-optic Communication Systems\u201d, 4th ed. Wiley series in microwave and optical engineering 222. New York: Wiley, 2010.].\n\nAdditionally, ideally distributed Raman amplification may be applied, which is implemented as in [N. J. Muga, M. C. Fugihara, M. F. S. Ferreira, and A. N. Pinto, \u201cASE Noise Simulation in Raman Amplification Systems\u201d, Conftele, 2009.]. Please note that the implemented Raman amplification currently results in a transparent fiber link. Hence, the introduced gain cannot be parametrized.\n\nThe SSFM operates on normalized time $T_\\text{norm}$ (e.g., $T_\\text{norm}=1\\,\\text{ps}=1\\cdot 10^{-12}\\,\\text{s}$) and distance units $L_\\text{norm}$(e.g., $L_\\text{norm}=1\\,\\text{km}=1\\cdot 10^{3}\\,\\text{m}$). Hence, all parameters as well as the signal itself have to be given with the same unit prefix for the same unit (e.g., always pico for time, or kilo for distance). Despite the normalization, the SSFM is implemented with physical units, which is different from the normalization, e.g., used for the nonlinear Fourier transform. For simulations, only $T_\\text{norm}$ has to be provided.\n\nTo avoid reflections at the signal boundaries during simulation, a Hamming window can be applied in each SSFM-step, whose length can be defined by half_window_length.\n\n**Example**\nSetting-up:\n```python\nssfm = SSFM(\n    alpha=0.046,\n    beta_2=-21.67,\n    f_c=193.55e12,\n    gamma=1.27,\n    half_window_length=100,\n    length=80,\n    n_ssfm=200,\n    n_sp=1.0,\n    t_norm=1e-12,\n    with_amplification=False,\n    with_attenuation=True,\n    with_dispersion=True,\n    with_manakov=False,\n    with_nonlinearity=True)\n```\n\nRunning:\n```python\n# x is the optical input signal\ny = ssfm(x)\n```\n\n**Parameters**\n\n- `alpha` (float): Attenuation coefficient $\\alpha$ in $(1/L_\\text{norm})$.

It refers to the process where a wave or a particle deviates from its original trajectory due to non-uniformities or structures in the medium it's propagating through. This can include reflection, refraction, and diffraction of waves off surfaces and obstacles, or the interaction of particles with other particles.\n\nIn the context of wireless propagation modeling, scattering is crucial as it affects the signal strength and quality. For instance, when a radio wave encounters a building or other obstacle, part of the wave is reflected, part is transmitted (or refracted), and part is scattered in various directions. This scattering can cause multipath propagation where the signal reaches the receiver via multiple paths, leading to interference that can either enhance or degrade the signal.\n\nScattering can be modeled using various techniques. One common approach is ray tracing, which simulates the propagation of waves by tracing their paths (or \"rays\") through the environment. This involves calculating the interactions of the rays with the surfaces and obstacles they encounter, including reflections, refractions, and diffractions. The result is a prediction of the signal strength and quality at different locations in the environment.\n\nIn the context provided, the Sionna Ray Tracing module is used for this purpose. The module uses the principles of electromagnetics, including the concepts of coordinate systems, vector fields, planar time-harmonic waves, and antenna patterns, to model the scattering and other interactions of the waves. The module also provides a definition of a channel impulse response, which describes the response of the wireless channel to an impulse of signal, taking into account all the propagation paths (direct and scattered) between the transmitter and receiver.\n\nThe modeling of scattering also involves the use of various mathematical and computational tools, such as spherical unit vectors, rotation matrices, and Fourier transforms. These tools allow the representation and manipulation of the electromagnetic fields and waves in a form suitable for numerical computation."}]}

Most importantly, without diffraction, there would be no field beyond the incident shadow boundary (ISB) in Region III. \n\nDiffraction is a very important phenomenon which enables wireless coverage behind buildings at positions without a line-of-sight of strong reflected path. As you move away from these boundaries, the diffracted field diminishes rapidly. Importantly, the contributions of the diffracted field become less significant as the carrier frequency increases. \n\nIn conclusion, diffraction plays a vital role in maintaining the consistency of the electric field across both reflection and incident shadow boundaries. It generates diffracted rays that form a Keller cone around an edge."}]}

This class is mainly responsible for determining the transmitter responsible for sending a specific stream to a particular receiver. Transmitters and receivers can be either user terminals or base stations depending on the set transmission mode - uplink or downlink.\n\nThe `StreamManagement` class carries several properties which are utilized to recover either desired or interfering channel coefficients. These coefficients are crucial for precoding and equalization processes. The class also offers numerous properties that can be employed in various scenarios. For instance, properties like `detection_desired_ind`, `detection_undesired_ind`, `num_interfering_streams_per_rx`, `num_rx`, `num_rx_per_tx`, `num_streams_per_rx`, `num_streams_per_tx`, `num_tx`, `num_tx_per_rx`, `precoding_ind`, `rx_stream_ids`, `rx_tx_association`, `stream_association`, `stream_ind`, and `tx_stream_ids`.\n\nA unique characteristic of the `StreamManagement` class is that it can be configured independent of the actual number of antennas at the transmitters and receivers, making it a flexible solution for stream management in MIMO networks. The configuration involves specifying the transmitter-receiver association, the number of streams per transmitter, and indicating which transmitter is associated with which receiver.\n\nHence, `StreamManagement` is essential in maintaining stream integrity and managing the allocation of streams between transmitters and receivers in multi-cellular MIMO network settings. Without effective stream management, interference between streams could lead to decreased network performance and efficiency. Ensuring that each transmitter and receiver pair is correctly associated and that each stream is appropriately handled is thus crucial for optimizing the performance of MIMO networks."}]}

Set up the different modes you want to compare. This could be different configurations of a communication system, different types of encoders or decoders, different modulation schemes, etc.\n\n2. For each mode, run a simulation using the same parameters (e.g., batch size, Eb/No values, number of target block errors, etc.). You can use the `simulate` method of the `sn.utils.PlotBER` class to run the simulation and measure the bit error rate (BER). \n\n3. During the simulation, record the time it takes to process a certain number of bits. This can be done by noting the start and end time of the simulation and dividing the total number of processed bits by the elapsed time. This will give you the throughput in bits per second.\n\n4. Repeat the above steps for each mode you want to compare.\n\n5. Finally, compare the throughput values of the different modes. The mode with the highest throughput is the most efficient one.\n\nNote: The throughput can be affected by various factors such as the complexity of the encoder/decoder, the modulation scheme, the batch size, and the specific hardware you are using.

Here are the major functionalities:\n\nFiltering: \n- `SincFilter`: Apply a sinc filter to an input signal. This is a layer for applying a sinc filter to an input sequence. It is defined by the product of the span in symbols and the oversampling factor.\n- `RaisedCosineFilter`: Apply a raised-cosine filter to an input signal defined by the roll-off factor and the symbol duration.\n- `RootRaisedCosineFilter`: Apply a root-raised-cosine filter to an input signal defined by the roll-off factor and the symbol duration.\n- `CustomFilter`: Define and apply a custom filter to an input signal. You can specify your custom filter coefficients.\n- `Filter`: This is an abstract class for defining a filter of any length.\n\nWindowing:\n- `HannWindow`, `HammingWindow`, `BlackmanWindow`, `CustomWindow`, and `Window`: These classes apply various windowing functions, including Hann, Hamming, Blackman, as well as a class for user-defined window functions.\n\nUpsampling: \n- `Upsampling` class: Perform upsampling by inserting zeros between samples. This technique is used to increase the data rate or to make the signal suitable for further processing.\n\nDownsampling:\n- `Downsampling` class: Perform downsampling by retaining one out of certain numbers of elements. It's used to decrease the rate of data or to adjust the signal to a different data rate.\n\nMoreover, the Sionna API also includes functions for signal analysis, such as:\n- `convolve`: Convolve a signal with a kernel.\n- `fft`: Computes the normalized discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a signal.\n- `ifft`: Computes the normalized discrete inverse Fourier transform (IDFT) of a signal.\n-  `empirical_psd`: Compute the empirical power spectral density of a signal.\n-  `empirical_aclr`: Compute the empirical adjacent channel leakage ratio of a signal.\n\nIn your processing pipeline, you can adjust these filters and functions as per your requirement. The sequence in the context is first upsampled using the `Upsampling` class and then filtered using a defined filter like root-raised-cosine filter. On the receiver side, to recover the baseband symbols, the received signal is filtered again using the corresponding filter and then downsampled. \n\nThese features are primarily used in digital signal processing for tasks like signal generation, modification, analysis etc which are integral part of communication system design, audio processing, image processing and many more.

In other words, for a given transmitter, it associates every point on a surface with the power that a receiver with a specific orientation would observe at this point. A coverage map is not uniquely defined as it depends on the transmit and receive arrays and their respective antenna patterns, the transmitter and receiver orientations, as well as transmit precoding and receive combining vectors. Moreover, a coverage map is not continuous but discrete because the plane needs to be quantized into small rectangular bins.\n\nIn Sionna, coverage maps are computed with the help of the function coverage_map() which returns an instance of CoverageMap. They can be visualized by providing them either as arguments to the functions render(), render_to_file(), and preview(), or by using the class method show().\n\nA very useful feature is sample_positions() which allows sampling of random positions within the scene that have sufficient coverage from a specific transmitter. This feature is used in the Sionna Ray Tracing Tutorial to generate a dataset of channel impulse responses for link-level simulations.\n\nFor class sionna.rt.CoverageMap, it Stores the simulated coverage maps.\n\nA coverage map is generated for the loaded scene for every transmitter using coverage_map(). Please refer to the documentation of this function for further details.\n\nAn instance of this class can be indexed like a tensor of rank three with shape [num_tx, num_cells_y, num_cells_x], i.e.:\n\n```python\ncm = scene.coverage_map()\nprint(cm[0])      # prints the coverage map for transmitter 0\nprint(cm[0,1,2])  # prints the value of the cell (1,2) for transmitter 0\n```\nwhere scene is the Scene loaded using load_scene().\n\n**Example**\n```python\nimport sionna\nfrom sionna.rt import load_scene, PlanarArray, Transmitter, Receiver\nscene = load_scene(sionna.rt.scene.munich)\n\n# Configure antenna array for all transmitters\nscene.tx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=8,\n                          num_cols=2,\n                          vertical_spacing=0.7,\n                          horizontal_spacing=0.5,\n                          pattern=\"tr38901\",\n                          polarization=\"VH\")\n\n# Configure antenna array for all receivers\nscene.rx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=1,\n                          num_cols=1,\n                          vertical_spacing=0.5,\n                          horizontal_spacing=0.5,\n                          pattern=\"dipole\",\n                          polarization=\"cross\")\n# Add a transmitters\ntx = Transmitter(name=\"tx\",\n              position=[8.5,21,30],\n              orientation=[0,0,0])\nscene.add(tx)\ntx.look_at([40,80,1.5])\n\n# Compute coverage map\ncm = scene.coverage_map(max_depth=8)\n\n# Show coverage map\ncm.show()\n```\n[Result](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/_images/coverage_map_show.png)\n\n### Properties\n\n**Property: `cell_centers`**\nGet the positions of the centers of the cells in the global coordinate system.\n- **Type**: `[num_cells_y, num_cells_x, 3]`, `tf.float`\n\n**Property: `cell_size`**\nGet the resolution of the coverage map, i.e., the width (in the local X direction) and height (in the local Y direction) of the cells of the coverage map.\n- **Type**: `[2]`, `tf.float`\n\n**Property: `center`**\nGet the center of the coverage map.\n- **Type**: `[3]`, `tf.float`\n\n**Property: `num_cells_x`**\nGet the number of cells along the local X-axis.\n- **Type**: `int`\n\n**Property: `num_cells_y`**\nGet the number of cells along the local Y-axis.\n- **Type**: `int`\n\n**Property: `num_tx`**\nGet the number of transmitters.\n- **Type**: `int`\n\n**Property: `orientation`**\nGet the orientation of the coverage map.\n- **Type**: `[3]`, `tf.float`\n\n**Property: `size`**\nGet the size of the coverage map.\n- **Type**: `[2]`, `tf.float`\n\n### Methods\n\n**Method: `as_tensor()`[source](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/_modules/sionna/rt/coverage_map.html#CoverageMap.as_tensor)**\nReturns the coverage map as a tensor.\n- **Output**: `[num_tx, num_cells_y, num_cells_x]`, `tf.float` \u2013 The coverage map as a tensor.\n- source code:\n```python\n    def as_tensor(self):\n        return self._value\n```\n\n**Method: `sample_positions(batch_size, tx=0, min_gain_db=None, max_gain_db=None, min_dist=None, max_dist=None, center_pos=False)`[source](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/_modules/sionna/rt/coverage_map.html#CoverageMap.sample_positions)**\nSample random user positions from a coverage map.\n\nFor a given coverage map, batch_size random positions are sampled such that the expected path gain of this position is larger than a given threshold min_gain_db or smaller than max_gain_db, respectively. Similarly, min_dist and max_dist define the minimum and maximum distance of the random positions to the transmitter tx.\n\nNote that due to the quantization of the coverage map into cells it is not guaranteed that all above parameters are exactly fulfilled for a returned position. This stems from the fact that every individual cell of the coverage map describes the expected average behavior of the surface within this cell. For instance, it may happen that half of the selected cell is shadowed and, thus, no path to the transmitter exists but the average path gain is still larger than the given threshold. Please use center_pos = True to sample only positions from the cell centers.\n\n[Coverage Map](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/_images/cm_user_sampling.png)\n\nThe above figure shows an example for random positions between 220m and 250m from the transmitter and a max_gain_db of -100 dB. Keep in mind that the transmitter can have a different height than the coverage map which also contributes to this distance. For example if the transmitter is located 20m above the surface of the coverage map and a min_dist of 20m is selected, also positions directly below the transmitter are sampled.\n\n- **Input**:\n  - `batch_size` (int): Number of returned random positions.\n  - `min_gain_db` (float | None): Minimum path gain [dB].

This function takes two arguments: the original bits and the recovered bits. \n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to compute the BER:\n\n1. First, you need to generate the transmit signal and information bits. This can be done using the `PUSCHTransmitter` class in the Sionna library. For example:\n\n```python\npusch_transmitter = PUSCHTransmitter(pusch_config)\nx, b = pusch_transmitter(batch_size) \n```\n\nIn this code, `pusch_config` is an instance of the `PUSCHConfig` class that defines the configuration of the PUSCH transmission, and `batch_size` is the number of transmissions you want to simulate.\n\n2. Next, you need to simulate the channel output. This can be done using the `AWGN` class for an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel or other channel classes for different types of channels. For example:\n\n```python\nchannel = AWGN()\nno = 0.1 # Noise variance\ny = channel([x, no]) \n```\n\n3. Then, you need to recover the information bits from the channel output. This can be done using the `PUSCHReceiver` class. For example:\n\n```python\npusch_receiver = PUSCHReceiver(pusch_transmitter)\nb_hat = pusch_receiver([y, no]) \n```\n\n4. Finally, you can compute the BER using the `compute_ber` function. For example:\n\n```python\nprint(\"BER:\", compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy())\n```\n\nThe output of the `compute_ber` function is the ratio of the number of bit errors (the number of bits that have been altered due to noise, interference, or other errors in the physical medium) to the total number of bits transmitted, received, or processed over a communication channel. A lower BER indicates better performance."}]}

The user can create their own scenes or use several integrated example scenes provided by Sionna. It is paramount for constructing and visualizing the propagation environment, which can include aspects such as buildings, antennas, transmitters, and receivers.\n\nThe 'Scene' component offers the following primary methods:\n\n1. `compute_paths()`: This method is used for the computation of propagation paths. It calculates the potential paths that a ray could take within a defined scene considering various aspects like reflection, diffraction, and scattering.\n\n2. `coverage_map()`: This method creates a coverage map, showing the signal strength or reception quality on a two-dimensional grid. It is particularly useful for analyzing and visualizing the areas of strong and weak coverage within a scene.\n\n3. `preview()`: As the name suggests, this method allows you to preview a scene within a Jupyter notebook. It helps to visualize and validate your scene configuration before running intensive computations.\n\n4. `render()` and `render_to_file()`: These methods are used to render the scene from a camera's viewpoint. It can either display the output on-screen (`render()`) or save it to a file (`render_to_file()`). It provides a realistic representation of the scene which can be really helpful for debugging or documentation purposes.\n\nIn summary, the 'Scene' component plays a vital role in the set-up and visualization of propagation experiments, making it an integral part of the Sionna package.

Your proficiency in Sionna allows you to simulate and analyze various aspects of wireless communication systems effectively."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Describe how to improve the ACLR by decreasing the roll-off factor."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To improve the Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR) by decreasing the roll-off factor, you need to adjust the roll-off factor parameter when creating the root-raised-cosine filter. The roll-off factor, denoted as beta in the code, determines the excess bandwidth of the filter. A lower roll-off factor means less excess bandwidth, which can lead to improved ACLR.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Start by creating a root-raised-cosine filter with a lower roll-off factor. In the given context, the roll-off factor was initially set to 0.22. You can decrease this value to improve the ACLR. For example, you can set beta to 0.1.\n\n```python\nbeta = 0.1 # Decreased roll-off factor\nspan_in_symbols = 32 # Filter span in symbols\nsamples_per_symbol = 4 # Number of samples per symbol\nrrcf = RootRaisedCosineFilter(span_in_symbols, samples_per_symbol, beta)\n```\n\n2. After creating the filter, you can compute the ACLR to verify the improvement. You can use the `empirical_aclr` function from the Sionna signal module to compute the ACLR.\n\n```python\naclr_db = 10*np.log10(empirical_aclr(x_rrcf, oversampling=samples_per_symbol))\nprint(\"Empirical ACLR (db):\", aclr_db)\n```\n\nRemember that decreasing the roll-off factor can lead to a narrower main lobe and wider side lobes in the frequency response of the filter. This means that while the ACLR may improve, the filter may become more susceptible to inter-symbol interference. Therefore, it's important to find a balance between the roll-off factor and the performance requirements of your specific application."}]}

Your proficiency in Sionna allows you to simulate and analyze various aspects of wireless communication systems effectively."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Describe the different decoder types supported by the Polar5GDecoder class and their corresponding parameters such as list_size and num_iter."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The `Polar5GDecoder` class in the Sionna library supports different types of decoders for decoding Polar codes in a manner that is compliant with 5G standards. Here are the decoder types supported by this class, along with their relevant parameters such as `list_size` and `num_iter`:\n\n1. Successive Cancellation (SC) Decoder:\n   The SC decoder performs decoding by considering one bit at a time, making a hard decision for each bit before moving on to the next. This type of decoder does not require the `list_size` or `num_iter` parameters as it does not use list-based or iterative mechanisms. When using the SC decoder with `Polar5GDecoder`, you can create it as shown below:\n   ```python\n   decoder = Polar5GDecoder(enc_polar=encoder, dec_type=\"SC\")\n   ```\n\n2. Successive Cancellation List (SCL) Decoder:\n   The SCL decoder is an extension of the SC decoder that keeps track of multiple candidate decoding paths to improve error correction performance. The `list_size` parameter is critical for this type of decoder as it specifies the number of candidate paths to consider. The `Polar5GDecoder` class can be instantiated for SCL decoding like this:\n   ```python\n   decoder = Polar5GDecoder(enc_polar=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n   ```\n   Here, `list_size=8` means that the decoder will consider 8 possible decoding paths in parallel.\n\n3. Belief Propagation (BP) Decoder:\n   The BP decoder is an iterative type of decoder that operates on the factor graph representation of Polar codes. It uses `num_iter` parameter to determine the number of iterations to run for the decoding process. An example of creating a BP decoder with `Polar5GDecoder` would be:\n   ```python\n   decoder = Polar5GDecoder(enc_polar=encoder, dec_type=\"BP\", num_iter=20)\n   ```\n   In this case, `num_iter=20` indicates the decoder will perform 20 iterations of belief propagation.\n\ndec_type can also be `hybSCL`.\n\nNote that the `enc_polar` parameter is where you provide an instance of `Polar5GEncoder` used during encoding, which is required for setting up the `Polar5GDecoder`.\n\n`return_crc_status` is a boolean parameter that, if set to `True`, allows the decoder to also return the CRC status, indicating whether a codeword was likely correctly recovered. `output_dtype` specifies the output data type of the layer.\n\nMoreover, it is important to note that while the Successive Cancellation (SC) and Belief Propagation (BP) decoders can perform CRC-aided decoding, they cannot fully utilize the CRC, which results in an effective rate loss compared to list-based decoders that use the CRC to prune unlikely paths.\n\nRemember that when referencing Sionna APIs to instantiate classes or call methods, you must use the correct import statements. For instance, to use `Polar5GDecoder`, you would use:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.decoding import Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nWhen implementing the decoders, make sure to refer to the provided context and Sionna\u2019s official documentation for exact syntax, as errors in the code can lead to incorrect behavior of the decoders."}]}

In the context provided, a 3D rotation is defined by yaw, pitch, and roll angles, represented by the Greek letters alpha, beta, and gamma respectively. These rotations are expressed by a rotation matrix R(alpha, beta, gamma), which is a product of rotation matrices around the z, y, and x axes.\n\nThe reverse rotation is defined as the inverse of this rotation matrix, denoted as R^(-1)(alpha, beta, gamma).

Therefore, the reverse rotation can also be defined as the transpose of the rotation matrix, denoted as R^(T)(alpha, beta, gamma).\n\nIn practical terms, a reverse rotation means rotating a system back to its original orientation after it has been rotated. For example, if a system is first rotated by an angle theta around a certain axis, the reverse rotation would involve rotating the system by the same angle theta in the opposite direction around the same axis.

Its primary role is to compute the time-domain representation of an OFDM resource grid, which is essentially a two-dimensional grid representing the mapping of data and alignments onto a sequence of OFDM symbols.\n\nTo implement this class, you would initialize an instance of it, specifying the `cyclic_prefix_length` as a parameter:\n\n```python\nmodulator = sionna.ofdm.OFDMModulator(cyclic_prefix_length=cp_length)\n```\n\nWhere `cp_length` is an integer indicating the length of the cyclic prefix that is prepended to each OFDM symbol.\n\nThen you can use this instance to convert a resource grid in the frequency domain into a time-domain signal.

It can be used to iteratively estimate/recover the transmitted codeword (or information bits) based on the LLR-values of the received noisy codeword observation.\n\nThe decoder implements the flooding SPA algorithm [Ryan], i.e., all nodes are updated in a parallel fashion. Different check node update functions are available.  \n  \n1. boxplus  \n$y_{j \\to i} = 2 \\operatorname{tanh}^{-1} \\left( \\prod_{i' \\in \\mathcal{N}_(j) \\setminus i} \\operatorname{tanh} \\left( \\frac{x_{i' \\to j}}{2} \\right) \\right)$\n2. boxplus-phi    \n$y_{j \\to i} = \\alpha_{j \\to i} \\cdot \\phi \\left( \\sum_{i' \\in \\mathcal{N}_(j) \\setminus i} \\phi \\left( |x_{i' \\to j}|\\right) \\right)$\nwith   $\\phi(x)=-\\operatorname{log}(\\operatorname{tanh} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}) \\right)$\n3. minsum  \n$\\qquad y_{j \\to i} = \\alpha_{j \\to i} \\cdot {min}_{i' \\in \\mathcal{N}_(j) \\setminus i} \\left(|x_{i' \\to j}|\\right)$  \nwhere $y_{j \\to i}$ denotes the message from check node (CN) j to variable node (VN) i and $x_{i \\to j}$ from VN i to CN j, respectively. Further, $\\mathcal{N}_(j)$ denotes all indices of connected VNs to CN j and  $\\alpha_{j \\to i} = \\prod_{i' \\in \\mathcal{N}_(j) \\setminus i} \\operatorname{sign}(x_{i' \\to j})$ is the sign of the outgoing message. For further details we refer to [W. Ryan, \u201cAn Introduction to LDPC codes\u201d, CRC Handbook for Coding and Signal Processing for Recording Systems, 2004.].  \n  \nNote that for full 5G 3GPP NR compatibility, the correct puncturing and shortening patterns must be applied (cf. [T. Richardson and S. Kudekar. \u201cDesign of low-density parity-check codes for 5G new radio,\u201d IEEE Communications Magazine 56.3, 2018.] for details), this can be done by LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, respectively.  \n  \nIf required, the decoder can be made trainable and is fully differentiable by following the concept of weighted BP [E. Nachmani, Y. Be\u2019ery, and D. Burshtein. \u201cLearning to decode linear codes using deep learning,\u201d IEEE Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton), 2016.] as shown in [Fig. 1](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/_images/weighted_bp.png) leading to $y_{j \\to i} = 2 \\operatorname{tanh}^{-1} \\left( \\prod_{i' \\in \\mathcal{N}_(j) \\setminus i} \\operatorname{tanh} \\left( \\frac{\\textcolor{red}{w_{i' \\to j}} \\cdot x_{i' \\to j}}{2} \\right) \\right)$ where $w_{i \\to j}$ denotes the trainable weight of message $x_{i \\to j}$. Please note that the training of some check node types may be not supported.  \n  \nFor numerical stability, the decoder applies LLR clipping of +/- 20 to the input LLRs.  \n  \nThe class inherits from the Keras layer class and can be used as layer in a Keras model.  \n  \n### Parameters\n\n- `pcm` (ndarray): An ndarray of shape `[n-k, n]` defining the parity-check matrix consisting only of 0 or 1 entries. Can also be of type `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` or `scipy.sparse.csc_matrix`.\n- `trainable` (bool): Defaults to `False`. If `True`, every outgoing variable node message is scaled with a trainable scalar.\n- `cn_type` (str): A string defaults to `\"boxplus-phi\"`. One of `{\"boxplus\", \"boxplus-phi\", \"minsum\"}` where `\"boxplus\"` implements the single-parity-check APP decoding rule. `\"boxplus-phi\"` implements the numerically more stable version of boxplus [W. Ryan, \u201cAn Introduction to LDPC codes\u201d, CRC Handbook for Coding and Signal Processing for Recording Systems, 2004.]. `\"minsum\"` implements the min-approximation of the CN update rule [W. Ryan, \u201cAn Introduction to LDPC codes\u201d, CRC Handbook for Coding and Signal Processing for Recording Systems, 2004.].\n- `hard_out` (bool): Defaults to `True`. If `True`, the decoder provides hard-decided codeword bits instead of soft-values.\n- `track_exit` (bool): Defaults to `False`. If `True`, the decoder tracks EXIT characteristics. Note that this requires the all-zero CW as input.\n- `num_iter` (int): Defines the number of decoder iterations (no early stopping used at the moment!).\n- `stateful` (bool): Defaults to `False`. If `True`, the internal VN messages `msg_vn` from the last decoding iteration are returned, and `msg_vn` or `None` needs to be given as a second input when calling the decoder. This is required for iterative demapping and decoding.\n- `output_dtype` (tf.DType): Defaults to `tf.float32`. Defines the output datatype of the layer (internal precision remains `tf.float32`).  \n  \n### Input\n\n- `llrs_ch` or `(llrs_ch, msg_vn)` (Tensor or Tuple): Only required Tuple if `stateful` is `True`.\n  - `llrs_ch` ([\u2026,n], tf.float32): 2+D tensor containing the channel logits/llr values.\n  - `msg_vn` (None or RaggedTensor, tf.float32): Ragged tensor of VN messages. Required only if `stateful` is `True`.\n  \n### Output\n\n- `[...,n], tf.float32`: 2+D Tensor of the same shape as inputs containing bit-wise soft-estimates (or hard-decided bit-values) of all codeword bits.\n- `RaggedTensor, tf.float32`: Tensor of VN messages. Returned only if `stateful` is set to `True`.  \n  \n### Attributes\n\n- `pcm` (ndarray): An ndarray of shape `[n-k, n]` defining the parity-check matrix consisting only of 0 or 1 entries. Can be also of type `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` or `scipy.sparse.csc_matrix`.\n- `num_cns` (int): Defining the number of check nodes.\n- `num_vns` (int): Defining the number of variable nodes.\n- `num_edges` (int): Defining the total number of edges.\n- `trainable` (bool): If `True`, the decoder uses trainable weights.\n- `_atanh_clip_value` (float): Defining the internal clipping value before the `atanh` is applied (relates to the CN update).\n- `_cn_type` (str): Defining the CN update function type.\n- `_cn_update`: A function defining the CN update.\n- `_hard_out` (bool): If `True`, the decoder outputs hard-decided bits.\n- `_cn_con` (ndarray): An ndarray of shape `[num_edges]` defining all edges from check node perspective.\n- `_vn_con` (ndarray): An ndarray of shape `[num_edges]` defining all edges from variable node perspective.\n- `_vn_mask_tf` (tf.float32): A ragged Tensor of shape `[num_vns, None]` defining the incoming message indices per VN. The second dimension is ragged and depends on the node degree.\n- `_cn_mask_tf` (tf.float32): A ragged Tensor of shape `[num_cns, None]` defining the incoming message indices per CN. The second dimension is ragged and depends on the node degree.\n- `_ind_cn` (ndarray): An ndarray of shape `[num_edges]` defining the permutation index to rearrange messages from variable into check node perspective.\n- `_ind_cn_inv` (ndarray): An ndarray of shape `[num_edges]` defining the permutation index to rearrange messages from check into variable node perspective.\n- `_vn_row_splits` (ndarray): An ndarray of shape `[num_vns+1]` defining the row split positions of a 1D vector consisting of all edges messages. Used to build a ragged Tensor of incoming VN messages.\n- `_cn_row_splits` (ndarray): An ndarray of shape `[num_cns+1]` defining the row split positions of a 1D vector consisting of all edges messages. Used to build a ragged Tensor of incoming CN messages.\n- `_edge_weights` (tf.float32): A Tensor of shape `[num_edges]` defining a (trainable) weight per outgoing VN message.\n  \n### Raises\n\n- `ValueError`: If the shape of `pcm` is invalid or contains other values than 0 or 1 or `dtype` is not `tf.float32`.\n- `ValueError`: If `num_iter` is not an integer greater (or equal) 0.\n- `ValueError`: If `output_dtype` is not `{tf.float16, tf.float32, tf.float64}`.\n- `ValueError`: If `inputs` is not of shape `[batch_size, n]`.\n- `InvalidArgumentError`: When `rank(inputs)<2`.\n  \n**Note: **  \nAs decoding input logits $\\operatorname{log} \\frac{p(x=1)}{p(x=0)}$ are assumed for compatibility with the learning framework, but internally log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) with definition $\\operatorname{log} \\frac{p(x=0)}{p(x=1)}$ are used.\nThe decoder is not (particularly) optimized for quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes and, thus, supports arbitrary parity-check matrices.  \nThe decoder is implemented by using \u2018\u201cragged Tensors\u201d\u2019 [https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/ragged_tensor] to account for arbitrary node degrees. To avoid a performance degradation caused by a severe indexing overhead, the batch-dimension is shifted to the last dimension during decoding.\nIf the decoder is made trainable [E. Nachmani, Y. Be\u2019ery, and D. Burshtein. \u201cLearning to decode linear codes using deep learning,\u201d IEEE Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton), 2016.], for performance improvements only variable to check node messages are scaled as the VN operation is linear and, thus, would not increase the expressive power of the weights.  \n  \n### Properties\n\n- `edge_weights`: Trainable weights of the BP decoder.\n- `has_weights`: Indicates if the decoder has trainable weights.\n- `ie_c`: Extrinsic mutual information at the check node.\n- `ie_v`: Extrinsic mutual information at the variable node.\n- `llr_max`: Max LLR value used for internal calculations and rate-matching.\n- `num_cns`: Number of check nodes.\n- `num_edges`: Number of edges in the decoding graph.\n- `num_iter`: Number of decoding iterations.\n- `num_vns`: Number of variable nodes.\n- `output_dtype`: Output dtype of the decoder.\n- `pcm`: Parity-check matrix of the LDPC code.\n\n### Methods\n\n- `show_weights(size=7)`: Show a histogram of trainable weights.\n    - `size` (float): Figure size of the matplotlib figure.  \n    - sample to use the method:\n```python\n# decoder is an instance of LDPCBPDecoder  \ndecoder.show_weights()\n```\n  "}]}

Attenuation is an inherent property of all media, including optical fibers, and it results in the loss of signal power over distance. The amplifier gain is chosen such that the link becomes transparent, meaning the input power equals the output power. This ensures that the signal can be transmitted over long distances without significant loss of power.\n\nThe noise figure (F) of each EDFA is related to the noise introduced by the amplifiers, specifically the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise. This noise is the most dominant source of noise in an optical channel model. The noise power depends on the gain (G), the noise figure (F), the carrier frequency, and the simulation bandwidth. The noise figure is a measure of the degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) caused by components in a signal chain. It is a number by which the performance of an amplifier or a radio receiver can be specified, with lower values indicating better performance. \n\nIn summary, the amplifier gain is used to compensate for signal attenuation, while the noise figure is a measure of the noise introduced by the amplifiers. Both of these factors significantly impact the performance of the optical channel."}]}

Pilot symbols (also known as reference signals) are known sequences that are sent along with the data to aid in channel estimation and equalization at the receiver. These pilot symbols are crucial as they help the receiver understand the channel conditions. However, the actual estimation method is not defined in the `BaseChannelEstimator` class and is left abstract, thus allowing flexibility in the implementation. Depending on the requirement, the subclass can implement algorithms such as Least Squares (LS) or Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) for channel estimation. \n\nChannel estimation is critical in OFDM-based systems as it estimates the channel's state, i.e. the path the signal takes from the transmitter to the receiver.

Nachmani, Y. Be\u2019ery, and D. Burshtein. \u201cLearning to decode linear codes using deep learning,\u201d IEEE Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton), 2016.].\n\nFor numerical stability, the decoder applies LLR clipping of +/- 20 to the input LLRs.\n\nThe class inherits from the Keras layer class and can be used as layer in a Keras model.\n  \n### Parameters\n\n- `encoder` (LDPC5GEncoder): An instance of `LDPC5GEncoder` containing the correct code parameters.\n- `trainable` (bool): Defaults to `False`. If `True`, every outgoing variable node message is scaled with a trainable scalar.\n- `cn_type` (str): A string defaults to `\"boxplus-phi\"`. One of `{\"boxplus\", \"boxplus-phi\", \"minsum\"}` where `\"boxplus\"` implements the single-parity-check APP decoding rule. `\"boxplus-phi\"` implements the numerically more stable version of boxplus [Ryan]. `\"minsum\"` implements the min-approximation of the CN update rule [Ryan].\n- `hard_out` (bool): Defaults to `True`. If `True`, the decoder provides hard-decided codeword bits instead of soft-values.\n- `track_exit` (bool): Defaults to `False`. If `True`, the decoder tracks EXIT characteristics. Note that this requires the all-zero CW as input.\n- `return_infobits` (bool): Defaults to `True`. If `True`, only the `k` info bits (soft or hard-decided) are returned. Otherwise, all `n` positions are returned.\n- `prune_pcm` (bool): Defaults to `True`. If `True`, all punctured degree-1 VNs and connected check nodes are removed from the decoding graph (see [Cammerer] for details). Besides numerical differences, this should yield the same decoding result but improve the decoding throughput and reduce the memory footprint.\n- `num_iter` (int): Defining the number of decoder iterations (no early stopping used at the moment!).\n- `stateful` (bool): Defaults to `False`. If `True`, the internal VN messages `msg_vn` from the last decoding iteration are returned, and `msg_vn` or `None` needs to be given as a second input when calling the decoder. This is required for iterative demapping and decoding.\n- `output_dtype` (tf.DType): Defaults to `tf.float32`. Defines the output datatype of the layer (internal precision remains `tf.float32`).\n  \n### Input\n\n- `llrs_ch` or `(llrs_ch, msg_vn)` \u2013 Tensor or Tuple (only required if `stateful` is `True`):\n    - `llrs_ch` ([...,n], `tf.float32`): 2+D tensor containing the channel logits/LLR values.\n    - `msg_vn` (`None` or `RaggedTensor`, `tf.float32`): Ragged tensor of VN messages. Required only if `stateful` is `True`.\n  \n### Output\n\n- `[...,n]` or `[...,k]`, `tf.float32`: 2+D Tensor of the same shape as inputs containing bit-wise soft-estimates (or hard-decided bit-values) of all codeword bits. If `return_infobits` is `True`, only the `k` information bits are returned.\n- `RaggedTensor`, `tf.float32`: Tensor of VN messages. Returned only if `stateful` is set to `True`.\n  \n### Raises\n\n- `ValueError`: If the shape of `pcm` is invalid or contains other values than 0 or 1.\n- `AssertionError`: If `trainable` is not `bool`.\n- `AssertionError`: If `track_exit` is not `bool`.\n- `AssertionError`: If `hard_out` is not `bool`.\n- `AssertionError`: If `return_infobits` is not `bool`.\n- `AssertionError`: If `encoder` is not an instance of `LDPC5GEncoder`.\n- `ValueError`: If `output_dtype` is not `{tf.float16, tf.float32, tf.float64}`.\n- `ValueError`: If `inputs` is not of shape `[batch_size, n]`.\n- `ValueError`: If `num_iter` is not an integer greater (or equal) 0.\n- `InvalidArgumentError`: When `rank(inputs) < 2`.\n  \n**Note: **  \nAs decoding input logits $\\operatorname{log} \\frac{p(x=1)}{p(x=0)}$ are assumed for compatibility with the learning framework, but internally llrs with definition $\\operatorname{log} \\frac{p(x=0)}{p(x=1)}$ are used.  \nThe decoder is not (particularly) optimized for Quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes and, thus, supports arbitrary parity-check matrices.  \nThe decoder is implemented by using \u2018\u201cragged Tensors\u201d\u2019 [https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/ragged_tensor] to account for arbitrary node degrees. To avoid a performance degradation caused by a severe indexing overhead, the batch-dimension is shifted to the last dimension during decoding.  \nIf the decoder is made trainable [E. Nachmani, Y. Be\u2019ery, and D. Burshtein. \u201cLearning to decode linear codes using deep learning,\u201d IEEE Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton), 2016.], for performance improvements only variable to check node messages are scaled as the VN operation is linear and, thus, would not increase the expressive power of the weights.  \n  \n### Properties  \n- `encoder`: LDPC Encoder used for rate-matching/recovery.  \n  "}]}

It is described by its channel coefficient $a_i$ and delay $\\tau_i$, as well as the angles of departure $(\\theta_{\\text{T},i}, \\varphi_{\\text{T},i})$ and arrival $(\\theta_{\\text{R},i}, \\varphi_{\\text{R},i})$. For more detail, see the [Primer on Electromagnetics](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/em_primer.html).\n\nIn Sionna, paths are computed with the help of the function compute_paths() which returns an instance of Paths. Paths can be visualized by providing them as arguments to the functions render(), render_to_file(), or preview().\n\nChannel impulse responses (CIRs) can be obtained with cir() which can then be used for link-level simulations. This is for example done in the [Sionna Ray Tracing Tutorial](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/examples/Sionna_Ray_Tracing_Introduction.html).\n\nFor sionna.rt.Paths, it Stores the simulated propagation paths. Paths are generated for the loaded scene using compute_paths(). Please refer to the documentation of this function for further details. These paths can then be used to compute channel impulse responses:\n```python\npaths = scene.compute_paths()\na, tau = paths.cir()\n```\nwhere scene is the Scene loaded using load_scene().\n\n**Properties**\n\n- **`a`**\n  Passband channel coefficients $a_i$ of each path as defined in [here](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/em_primer.html#equation-h-final).\n  - **Type**: `[batch_size, num_rx, num_rx_ant, num_tx, num_tx_ant, max_num_paths, num_time_steps]`, `tf.complex`\n\n- **`doppler`**\n  Doppler shift for each path related to movement of objects.

When there are multiple transmitters or receivers, path counts may vary between links. This is used to identify non-existent paths. For such paths, the channel coefficient is set to 0 and the delay to -1.\n  - **Type**: `[batch_size, num_rx, num_rx_ant, num_tx, num_tx_ant, max_num_paths]` or `[batch_size, num_rx, num_tx, max_num_paths]`, `tf.bool`\n\n- **`normalize_delays`**\n  Set to True to normalize path delays such that the first path between any pair of antennas of a transmitter and receiver arrives at tau = 0.

To understand this process, let us consider a single propagation path undergoing $n$ scattering processes, such as reflection, diffuse scattering, or diffraction, as shown in the figure below.\n\n   [Figure](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/_images/doppler.png)\n  \n   The object on which lies the $i\\text{th}$ scattering point has the velocity vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{v}}_i$ and the outgoing ray direction at this point is denoted $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_i$. The first and last point correspond to the transmitter and receiver, respectively. We therefore have\n   $\\begin{split}\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_0 &= \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}(\\theta_{\\text{T}}, \\varphi_{\\text{T}})\\\\\n\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_{n} &= -\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}(\\theta_{\\text{R}}, \\varphi_{\\text{R}})\\end{split}$\n   where $(\\theta_{\\text{T}}, \\varphi_{\\text{T}})$ are the AoDs, $(\\theta_{\\text{R}}, \\varphi_{\\text{R}})$ are the AoAs, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}(\\theta,\\varphi)$ is defined in [here](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/em_primer.html#equation-spherical-vecs).\n   \n   If the transmitter emits a signal with frequency $f$, the receiver will observe the signal at frequency $f'=f + f_\\Delta$, where $f_\\Delta$ is the Doppler shift, which can be computed as [F.Wiffen et al., \u201cComparison of OTFS and OFDM in Ray Launched sub-6 GHz and mmWave Line-of-Sight Mobility Channels\u201d, Proc.

(PIMRC), Bologna, Italy, Sep. 2018.]\n   $f' = f \\prod_{i=0}^n \\frac{1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_{i+1}^\\mathsf{T}\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_i}{c}}{1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_{i}^\\mathsf{T}\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_i}{c}}.$\n\n   Under the assumption that $\\lVert \\mathbf{v}_i \\rVert\\ll c$, we can apply the Taylor expansion $(1-x)^{-1}\\approx 1+x$, for $x\\ll 1$, to the previous equation to obtain\n   $\\begin{split}f' &\\approx f \\prod_{i=0}^n \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_{i+1}^\\mathsf{T}\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_i}{c}\\right)\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_{i}^\\mathsf{T}\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_i}{c}\\right)\\\\\n   &\\approx f \\left(1 + \\sum_{i=0}^n \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_{i}^\\mathsf{T}\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_i -\\mathbf{v}_{i+1}^\\mathsf{T}\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_i}{c} \\right)\\end{split}$\n   where the second line results from ignoring terms in $c^{-2}$. Solving for $f_\\Delta$, grouping terms with the same $\\mathbf{v}_i$ together, and using $f=c/\\lambda$, we obtain\n   $f_\\Delta = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\left(\\mathbf{v}_{0}^\\mathsf{T}\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_0 - \\mathbf{v}_{n+1}^\\mathsf{T}\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_n + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{v}_{i}^\\mathsf{T}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_i-\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_{i-1} \\right) \\right) \\qquad \\text{[Hz]}.$\n\n   Using this Doppler shift, the time-dependent path coefficient is computed as\n   $a(t) = a e^{j2\\pi f_\\Delta t}.$\n   \n   Note that this model is only valid as long as the AoDs, AoAs, and path delays do not change significantly. This is typically the case for very short time intervals. Large-scale mobility should be simulated by moving objects within the scene and recomputing the propagation paths.\n\n   When this function is called multiple times, it overwrites the previous time step dimension.\n\n   **Input**\n\n  - `sampling_frequency` (float): Frequency [Hz] at which the channel impulse response is sampled.\n  - `num_time_steps` (int): Number of time steps.\n  - `tx_velocities` ([batch_size, num_tx, 3] or broadcastable, tf.float | None): Velocity vectors $(v_\\text{x}, v_\\text{y}, v_\\text{z})$ of all transmitters [m/s].

Import the required functions from the Sionna library:\n    ```python\n    from sionna.fec.utils import alist2mat, load_alist\n    from sionna.fec.linear import LinearEncoder\n    from sionna.fec.ldpc.decoding import LDPCBPDecoder\n    from sionna.utils import BinarySource\n    from sionna.mapping import Mapper\n    from sionna.mapping import Demapper\n    from sionna.channel import AWGN\n    ```\n2. Load the alist (parity-check matrix) file using \"load_alist\" function. Pass the path of your alist file to the function:\n    ```python\n    al = load_alist(path=filename) \n    ```\n3. Convert the alist file to a parity check matrix using the \"alist2mat\" function. This function will return the parity-check matrix, the number of information bits 'k', the number of codeword bits 'n', and the coderate.\n    ```python\n    pcm, k, n, coderate = alist2mat(al)\n    ```\n4. Initialize the Linear Encoder with the parity-check matrix. You can make use of the \"LinearEncoder\" function for this task.\n    ```python\n    encoder = LinearEncoder(pcm, is_pcm=True)\n    ```\n5. Now, initialize a BP Decoder for the given parity-check matrix using \"LDPCBPDecoder\" function. You can choose the number of iterations as per your preference (20 in this example).\n    ```python\n    decoder = LDPCBPDecoder(pcm, num_iter=20)\n    ```\n6. Run the simulation with random information bits. You can set a batch_size (for instance, 10), define the noise 'no', and select the number of bits per symbol. Use \"BinarySource\", \"Mapper\", \"AWGN\", and \"Demapper\" functions for this purpose.\n    ```python\n    no = 1.\n    batch_size = 10\n    num_bits_per_symbol = 2\n    source = BinarySource()\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    channel = AWGN()\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    u = source([batch_size, k])\n    c = encoder(u)\n    x = mapper(c)\n    y = channel([x, no])\n    llr = demapper([y, no])\n    ```\n7. get the decoder output\n    ```python\n    c_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\nBy following these steps you can import an external LDPC parity-check matrix from an alist file and set up an encoder/decoder using \"alist2mat\" function.

If the `target_rank` is smaller than the rank of the original tensor, the function will return the original tensor without making any changes.\n\n3. `axis` (optional): This represents the dimension index at which the new axes are going to be introduced in the tensor. This parameter is optional and is set to `-1` by default which is the last dimension. It can take any value in the range of `-(D+1)` and `D` inclusive, where `D` is the number of dimensions of the tensor.\n\n#### Function Call\nYou can call the function with all required parameters as follows:\n```python\nexpanded_tensor = expand_to_rank(tensor, target_rank, axis)\n```\n\n#### Function Output\nThe function will return a tensor with the same data as the original tensor but with additional dimensions depending on provided parameters. If the `target_rank` is lesser than or equal to the rank of the original tensor, the original tensor will be returned. The shape of the returned tensor thus depends on the parameters used.\n\n#### Example\nLet's assume you have a tensor `t` of shape [3, 4, 2] and you want to expand it to have a rank of 5 at axis 1. You can achieve this by using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom sionna.utils import expand_to_rank\n\n# create a random tensor t of shape [3, 4, 2]\nt = tf.random.normal([3, 4, 2])\n\n# expand tensor t to rank 5 at axis 1\nexpanded_t = expand_to_rank(t, 5, 1)\n\n# The resulting tensor will have a shape [3, 1, 1, 4, 2].\n```"}]}

If it's not installed, we catch the `ImportError` and install Sionna using `pip install sionna`, then import it.\n\nRemember to replace `gpu_num` with the number of the GPU you want to use. If you want to use the CPU, set `gpu_num` to an empty string (\"\"). \n\nAlso, note that the `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable is used to set the TensorFlow logging level. Setting it to '3' will mute all the logs from TensorFlow. \n\nFinally, the `tensorflow.keras` library is used to import `Model`, `Dense`, and `Layer` for the implementation of the neural receiver."}]}

R. Zheng and N. C. Beaulieu, \u201cNovel Sum-of-Sinusoids Simulation Models for Rayleigh and Rician Fading Channels,\u201d in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, vol. 5, no. 12, pp. 3667-3679, December 2006, doi: 10.1109/TWC.2006.256990.]. Channel aging is simulated in the event of mobility.\n\nIf a minimum speed and a maximum speed are specified such that the maximum speed is greater than the minimum speed, then speeds are randomly and uniformly sampled from the specified interval for each link and each batch example.\n\nThe TDL model only works for systems with a single transmitter and a single receiver. The transmitter and receiver can be equipped with multiple antennas. Spatial correlation is simulated through filtering by specified correlation matrices.\n\nThe spatial_corr_mat parameter can be used to specify an arbitrary spatial correlation matrix. In particular, it can be used to model correlated cross-polarized transmit and receive antennas as follows (see, e.g., Annex G.2.3.2.1 [3GPP TS 38.141-1 \u201cBase Station (BS) conformance testing Part 1: Conducted conformance testing\u201d, Release 17]): $\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{R}_{\\text{rx}} \\otimes \\mathbf{\\Gamma} \\otimes \\mathbf{R}_{\\text{tx}}$ where $\\mathbf{R}$ is the spatial correlation matrix spatial_corr_mat, $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{rx}}$ the spatial correlation matrix at the receiver with same polarization, $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{tx}}$ the spatial correlation matrix at the transmitter with same polarization, and $\\mathbf{\\Gamma}$ the polarization correlation matrix. $\\mathbf{\\Gamma}$  is 1x1 for single-polarized antennas, 2x2 when only the transmit or receive antennas are cross-polarized, and 4x4 when transmit and receive antennas are cross-polarized.\n\nIt is also possible not to specify spatial_corr_mat, but instead the correlation matrices at the receiver and transmitter, using the rx_corr_mat and tx_corr_mat parameters, respectively. This can be useful when single polarized antennas are simulated, and it is also more computationally efficient. This is equivalent to setting spatial_corr_mat to: $\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{R}_{\\text{rx}} \\otimes \\mathbf{R}_{\\text{tx}}$ where $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{rx}}$ is the correlation matrix at the receiver rx_corr_mat and $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{tx}}$ the correlation matrix at the transmitter tx_corr_mat.\n\nExample:\nThe following code snippet shows how to setup a TDL channel model assuming an OFDM waveform:\n```python\ntdl = TDL(model = \"A\",\n          delay_spread = 300e-9,\n          carrier_frequency = 3.5e9,\n          min_speed = 0.0,\n          max_speed = 3.0)\n\nchannel = OFDMChannel(channel_model = tdl,\n                      resource_grid = rg)\n```\nwhere rg is an instance of ResourceGrid.\n\n**Notes**\nThe following tables from [3GPP TR 38.901, \u201cStudy on channel model for frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz\u201d, Release 16.1] provide typical values for the delay spread.\n\n<table class=\"docutils align-default\">\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width: 58%\">\n<col style=\"width: 42%\">\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"row-odd\"><th class=\"head\"><p>Model</p></th>\n<th class=\"head\"><p>Delay spread [ns]</p></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"row-even\"><td><p>Very short delay spread</p></td>\n<td><p><span class=\"math notranslate nohighlight\"><mjx-container class=\"MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0\" jax=\"CHTML\" style=\"font-size: 114.7%;

The PSD is computed along the last dimension by averaging over all other dimensions.\n\n- **Inputs:** \n  - `x`: Tensor of complex number values. This is the signal for which to compute the ACLR.\n  - `oversampling`: Float value indicating the oversampling factor; this defaults to 1.\n  - `f_min`: Float value indicating the lower border of the in-band in normalized frequency, defaults to -0.5.\n  - `f_max`: Float value indicating the upper border of the in-band in normalized frequency, defaults to 0.5.\n\n- **Output:** \n  - `aclr`: Float value representing the computed ACLR (in linear scale).\n\nIf the in-band ranges from `f_min` to `f_max` (in normalized frequency), the function defines `aclr` (ACLR) as the ratio of out-of-band power to in-band power, given by `aclr` = `P_out` / `P_in`.\n\nIn coding scenarios, this function might be used when performing signal processing tasks that require computation of the adjacent channel leakage ratio. This might be helpful in scenarios where one needs to measure or quantify the interference caused by the power leakage from an adjacent frequency channel, which is a common task in telecommunications and digital signal processing. This could be crucial in analyzing and improving the performance of communication systems."}]}

The noise power `no` is per complex dimension. If `no` is a scalar, noise of the same variance will be added to the input. If `no` is a tensor, it must have a shape that can be broadcast to the shape of `x`. This allows, for example, adding noise of different variance to each example in a batch.
