Do not assume that code is unnecessary for the response; carefully consider if including it will substantively support your explanation. When it is required, the code must be transcribed with utmost accuracyâ€”verbatim, with no errors or omissions, and without adding redundant or meaningless code. If the code involves Sionna APIs, you need to be very careful not to import the wrong packages, such as confusing an encoder with a decoder. This is just an example; you should judge based on the actual situation. We rely on your discretion to judiciously include code snippets that are pertinent and to ensure their exactness. In both code and illustrations, do not 'assume'! If you know something, state it explicitly; if you are unsure, indicate that it needs to be verified. Do not say 'assume' because there may be instances where your assumption is incorrect."
